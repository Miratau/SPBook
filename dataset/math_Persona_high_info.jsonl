In a time series graph, the horizontal axis represents the time increments or dates, and the vertical axis represents the values of the variable being measured. Each point on the graph corresponds to a specific date and a measured quantity, and these points are typically connected by straight lines in sequential order, allowing for the visualization of trends and patterns in the data over time.

By using the F ratio, which is the ratio of the larger sample variance to the smaller sample variance, we can determine whether the variances of two populations are equal or significantly different.
