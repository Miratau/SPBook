                    "context": "Think about all of the technological devices that you use on a regular basis. Computers, wireless internet, smart phones, tablets, global positioning system (GPS), MP3 players, and satellite radio might come to mind. Next, think about the most exciting modern technologies that you have heard about in the news, such as trains that levitate above their tracks, invisibility cloaks that bend light around them, and microscopic robots that fight diseased cells in our bodies. All of these groundbreaking advancements rely on the principles of physics.\n\nPhysics is a branch of science. The word science comes from a Latin word that means having knowledge, and refers the knowledge of how the physical world operates, based on objective evidence determined through observation and experimentation. A key requirement of any scientific explanation of a natural phenomenon is that it must be testable; one must be able to devise and conduct an experimental investigation that either supports or refutes the explanation. It is important to note that some questions fall outside the realm of science precisely because they deal with phenomena that are not scientifically testable. This need for objective evidence helps define the investigative process scientists follow, which will be described later in this chapter.\n\nPhysics is the science aimed at describing the fundamental aspects of our universe. This includes what things are in it, what properties of those things are noticeable, and what processes those things or their properties undergo. In simpler terms, physics attempts to describe the basic mechanisms that make our universe behave the way it does. For example, consider a smart phone. Physics describes how electric current interacts with the various circuits inside the device. This knowledge helps engineers select the appropriate materials and circuit layout when building the smart phone. Next, consider a GPS. Physics describes the relationship between the speed of an object, the distance over which it travels, and the time it takes to travel that distance. When you use a GPS device in a vehicle, it utilizes these physics relationships to determine the travel time from one location to another.\n\nAs our technology evolved over the centuries, physics expanded into many branches. Ancient peoples could only study things that they could see with the naked eye or otherwise experience without the aid of scientific equipment. This included the study of kinematics, which is the study of moving objects. For example, ancient people often studied the apparent motion of objects in the sky, such as the sun, moon, and stars. This is evident in the construction of prehistoric astronomical observatories, such as Stonehenge in England (shown in Figure 1.3). \n\nAncient people also studied statics and dynamics, which focus on how objects start moving, stop moving, and change speed and direction in response to forces that push or pull on the objects. This early interest in kinematics and dynamics allowed humans to invent simple machines, such as the lever, the pulley, the ramp, and the wheel. These simple machines were gradually combined and integrated to produce more complicated machines, such as wagons and cranes. Machines allowed humans to gradually do more work more effectively in less time, allowing them to create larger and more complicated buildings and structures, many of which still exist today from ancient times.\n\nAs technology advanced, the branches of physics diversified even more. These include branches such as acoustics, the study of sound, and optics, the study of the light. In 1608, the invention of the telescope by a Germany spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, led to huge breakthroughs in astronomy\u2014the study of objects or phenomena in space. One year later, in 1609, Galileo Galilei began the first studies of the solar system and the universe using a telescope. During the Renaissance era, Isaac Newton used observations made by Galileo to construct his three laws of motion. These laws were the standard for studying kinematics and dynamics even today.\n\nAnother major branch of physics is thermodynamics, which includes the study of thermal energy and the transfer of heat. James Prescott Joule, an English physicist, studied the nature of heat and its relationship to work. Joule\u2019s work helped lay the foundation for the first of three laws of thermodynamics that describe how energy in our universe is transferred from one object to another or transformed from one form to another. Studies in thermodynamics were motivated by the need to make engines more efficient, keep people safe from the elements, and preserve food.\n\nThe 18th and 19th centuries also saw great strides in the study of electricity and magnetism. Electricity involves the study of electric charges and their movements. Magnetism had long ago been noticed as an attractive force between a magnetized object and a metal like iron, or between the opposite poles (North and South) of two magnetized objects. In 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted showed that electric currents create magnetic fields. In 1831, English inventor Michael Faraday showed that moving a wire through a magnetic field could induce an electric current. These studies led to the inventions of the electric motor and electric generator, which revolutionized human life by bringing electricity and magnetism into our machines.\n\nThe end of the 19th century saw the discovery of radioactive substances by the scientists Marie and Pierre Curie. Nuclear physics involves studying the nuclei of atoms, the source of nuclear radiation. In the 20th century, the study of nuclear physics eventually led to the ability to split the nucleus of an atom, a process called nuclear fission. This process is the basis for nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. Also, the field of quantum mechanics, which involves the mechanics of atoms and molecules, saw great strides during the 20th century as our understanding of atoms and subatomic particles increased (see below).\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Albert Einstein revolutionized several branches of physics, especially relativity. Relativity revolutionized our understanding of motion and the universe in general as described further in this chapter. Now, in the 21st century, physicists continue to study these and many other branches of physics.\n\nBy studying the most important topics in physics, you will gain analytical abilities that will enable you to apply physics far beyond the scope of what can be included in a single book. These analytical skills will help you to excel academically, and they will also help you to think critically in any career you choose to pursue.",

                    "context": "The word physics is thought to come from the Greek word phusis, meaning nature. The study of nature later came to be called natural philosophy. From ancient times through the Renaissance, natural philosophy encompassed many fields, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and medicine. Over the last few centuries, the growth of scientific knowledge has resulted in ever-increasing specialization and branching of natural philosophy into separate fields, with physics retaining the most basic facets. Physics, as it developed from the Renaissance to the end of the 19th century, is called classical physics. Revolutionary discoveries starting at the beginning of the 20th century transformed physics from classical physics to modern physics.\n\nClassical physics is not an exact description of the universe, but it is an excellent approximation under the following conditions: (1) matter must be moving at speeds less than about 1 percent of the speed of light, (2) the objects dealt with must be large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and (3) only weak gravity, such as that generated by Earth, can be involved. Very small objects, such as atoms and molecules, cannot be adequately explained by classical physics. These three conditions apply to almost all of everyday experience. As a result, most aspects of classical physics should make sense on an intuitive level.\n\nMany laws of classical physics have been modified during the 20th century, resulting in revolutionary changes in technology, society, and our view of the universe. As a result, many aspects of modern physics, which occur outside of the range of our everyday experience, may seem bizarre or unbelievable. So why is most of this textbook devoted to classical physics? There are two main reasons. The first is that knowledge of classical physics is necessary to understand modern physics. The second reason is that classical physics still gives an accurate description of the universe under a wide range of everyday circumstances.\n\nModern physics includes two revolutionary theories: relativity and quantum mechanics. These theories deal with the very fast and the very small, respectively. The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. By examining how two observers moving relative to each other would see the same phenomena, Einstein devised radical new ideas about time and space. He came to the startling conclusion that the measured length of an object travelling at high speeds (greater than about one percent of the speed of light) is shorter than the same object measured at rest. Perhaps even more bizarre is the idea the time for the same process to occur is different depending on the motion of the observer. Time passes more slowly for an object travelling at high speeds. A trip to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, might take an astronaut 4.5 Earth years if the ship travels near the speed of light. However, because time is slowed at higher speeds, the astronaut would age only 0.5 years during the trip. Einstein\u2019s ideas of relativity were accepted after they were confirmed by numerous experiments.\n\nGravity, the force that holds us to Earth, can also affect time and space. For example, time passes more slowly on Earth\u2019s surface than for objects farther from the surface, such as a satellite in orbit. The very accurate clocks on global positioning satellites have to correct for this. They slowly keep getting ahead of clocks at Earth\u2019s surface. This is called time dilation, and it occurs because gravity, in essence, slows down time.\n\nLarge objects, like Earth, have strong enough gravity to distort space. To visualize this idea, think about a bowling ball placed on a trampoline. The bowling ball depresses or curves the surface of the trampoline. If you rolled a marble across the trampoline, it would follow the surface of the trampoline, roll into the depression caused by the bowling ball, and hit the ball. Similarly, the Earth curves space around it in the shape of a funnel. These curves in space due to the Earth cause objects to be attracted to Earth (i.e., gravity).\n\nBecause of the way gravity affects space and time, Einstein stated that gravity affects the space-time continuum, as illustrated in Figure 1.4. This is why time proceeds more slowly at Earth\u2019s surface than in orbit. In black holes, whose gravity is hundreds of times that of Earth, time passes so slowly that it would appear to a far-away observer to have stopped!\n\nIn summary, relativity says that in describing the universe, it is important to realize that time, space and speed are not absolute. Instead, they can appear different to different observers. Einstein\u2019s ability to reason out relativity is even more amazing because we cannot see the effects of relativity in our everyday lives.\n\nQuantum mechanics is the second major theory of modern physics. Quantum mechanics deals with the very small, namely, the subatomic particles that make up atoms. Atoms are the smallest units of elements. However, atoms themselves are constructed of even smaller subatomic particles, such as protons, neutrons and electrons. Quantum mechanics strives to describe the properties and behavior of these and other subatomic particles. Often, these particles do not behave in the ways expected by classical physics. One reason for this is that they are small enough to travel at great speeds, near the speed of light.\n\nAt particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider on the France-Swiss border, particle physicists can make subatomic particles travel at very high speeds within a 27 kilometers (17 miles) long superconducting tunnel. They can then study the properties of the particles at high speeds, as well as collide them with each other to see how they exchange energy. This has led to many intriguing discoveries such as the Higgs-Boson particle, which gives matter the property of mass, and antimatter, which causes a huge energy release when it comes in contact with matter.\n\nPhysicists are currently trying to unify the two theories of modern physics, relativity and quantum mechanics, into a single, comprehensive theory called relativistic quantum mechanics. Relating the behavior of subatomic particles to gravity, time, and space will allow us to explain how the universe works in a much more comprehensive way.",

For example, physics can help you understand why you shouldn\u2019t put metal in the microwave, why a black car radiator helps remove heat in a car engine, and why a white roof helps keep the inside of a house cool. The operation of a car\u2019s ignition system, as well as the transmission of electrical signals through our nervous system, are much easier to understand when you think about them in terms of the basic physics of electricity.\n\nPhysics is the foundation of many important scientific disciplines. For example, chemistry deals with the interactions of atoms and molecules. Not surprisingly, chemistry is rooted in atomic and molecular physics. Most branches of engineering are also applied physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of determining structural stability, acoustics, heating, lighting, and cooling for buildings. Parts of geology, the study of nonliving parts of Earth, rely heavily on physics; including radioactive dating, earthquake analysis, and heat transfer across Earth\u2019s surface. Indeed, some disciplines, such as biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines.\n\nPhysics also describes the chemical processes that power the human body. Physics is involved in medical diagnostics, such as x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonic blood flow measurements. Medical therapy Physics also has many applications in biology, the study of life. For example, physics describes how cells can protect themselves using their cell walls and cell membranes. Medical therapy sometimes directly involves physics, such as in using X-rays to diagnose health conditions. Physics can also explain what we perceive with our senses, such as how the ears detect sound or the eye detects color.\n\nIn summary, physics studies many of the most basic aspects of science. A knowledge of physics is, therefore, necessary to understand all other sciences. This is because physics explains the most basic ways in which our universe works. However, it is not necessary to formally study all applications of physics. A knowledge of the basic laws of physics will be most useful to you, so that you can use them to solve some everyday problems.

                    "context": "Scientists often plan and carry out investigations to answer questions about the universe around us. These investigations may lead to natural laws. Such laws are intrinsic to the universe, meaning that humans did not create them and cannot change them. We can only discover and understand them. Their discovery is a very human endeavor, with all the elements of mystery, imagination, struggle, triumph, and disappointment inherent in any creative effort. The cornerstone of discovering natural laws is observation. Science must describe the universe as it is, not as we imagine or wish it to be.\n\nWe all are curious to some extent. We look around, make generalizations, and try to understand what we see. For example, we look up and wonder whether one type of cloud signals an oncoming storm. As we become serious about exploring nature, we become more organized and formal in collecting and analyzing data. We attempt greater precision, perform controlled experiments (if we can), and write down ideas about how data may be organized. We then formulate models, theories, and laws based on the data we have collected, and communicate those results with others. This, in a nutshell, describes the scientific method that scientists employ to decide scientific issues on the basis of evidence from observation and experiment.\n\nAn investigation often begins with a scientist making an observation. The scientist observes a pattern or trend within the natural world. Observation may generate questions that the scientist wishes to answer. Next, the scientist may perform some research about the topic and devise a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a testable statement that describes how something in the natural world works. In essence, a hypothesis is an educated guess that explains something about an observation.\n\nScientists may test the hypothesis by performing an experiment. During an experiment, the scientist collects data that will help them learn about the phenomenon they are studying. Then the scientists analyze the results of the experiment (that is, the data), often using statistical, mathematical, and/or graphical methods. From the data analysis, they draw conclusions. They may conclude that their experiment either supports or rejects their hypothesis. If the hypothesis is supported, the scientist usually goes on to test another hypothesis related to the first. If their hypothesis is rejected, they will often then test a new and different hypothesis in their effort to learn more about whatever they are studying.\n\nScientific processes can be applied to many situations. Let\u2019s say that you try to turn on your car, but it will not start. You have just made an observation! You ask yourself, \"Why won\u2019t my car start?\" You can now use scientific processes to answer this question. First, you generate a hypothesis such as, \"The car won\u2019t start because it has no gasoline in the gas tank.\" To test this hypothesis, you put gasoline in the car and try to start it again. If the car starts, then your hypothesis is supported by the experiment. If the car does not start, then your hypothesis is rejected. You will then need to think up a new hypothesis to test such as, \"My car won\u2019t start because the fuel pump is broken.\" Hopefully, your investigations lead you to discover why the car won\u2019t start and enable you to fix it.",

                    "context": "A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to study directly. Models can take the form of physical models, equations, computer programs, or simulations\u2014computer graphics/animations. Models are tools that are especially useful in modern physics because they let us visualize phenomena that we normally cannot observe with our senses, such as very small objects or objects that move at high speeds. For example, we can understand the structure of an atom using models, despite the fact that no one has ever seen an atom with their own eyes. Models are always approximate, so they are simpler to consider than the real situation; the more complete a model is, the more complicated it must be. Models put the intangible or the extremely complex into human terms that we can visualize, discuss, and hypothesize about.\n\nScientific models are constructed based on the results of previous experiments. Even still, models often only describe a phenomenon partially or in a few limited situations. Some phenomena are so complex that they may be impossible to model them in their entirety, even using computers. An example is the electron cloud model of the atom in which electrons are moving around the atom\u2019s center in distinct clouds, that represent the likelihood of finding an electron in different places. This model helps us to visualize the structure of an atom. However, it does not show us exactly where an electron will be within its cloud at any one particular time.\n\nAs mentioned previously, physicists use a variety of models including equations, physical models, computer simulations, etc. For example, three-dimensional models are often commonly used in chemistry and physics to model molecules. Properties other than appearance or location are usually modelled using mathematics, where functions are used to show how these properties relate to one another. Processes such as the formation of a star or the planets, can also be modelled using computer simulations. Once a simulation is correctly programmed based on actual experimental data, the simulation can allow us to view processes that happened in the past or happen too quickly or slowly for us to observe directly. In addition, scientists can also run virtual experiments using computer-based models. In a model of planet formation, for example, the scientist could alter the amount or type of rocks present in space and see how it affects planet formation.\n\nScientists use models and experimental results to construct explanations of observations or design solutions to problems. For example, one way to make a car more fuel efficient is to reduce the friction or drag caused by air flowing around the moving car. This can be done by designing the body shape of the car to be more aerodynamic, such as by using rounded corners instead of sharp ones. Engineers can then construct physical models of the car body, place them in a wind tunnel, and examine the flow of air around the model. This can also be done mathematically in a computer simulation. The air flow pattern can be analyzed for regions smooth air flow and for eddies that indicate drag. The model of the car body may have to be altered slightly to produce the smoothest pattern of air flow (i.e., the least drag). The pattern with the least drag may be the solution to increasing fuel efficiency of the car. This solution might then be incorporated into the car design.",

That is, physical laws are meant to be universal, meaning that they apply throughout the known universe. Laws are often also concise, whereas theories are more complicated. A law can be expressed in the form of a single sentence or mathematical equation. For example, Newton\u2019s second law of motion, which relates the motion of an object to the force applied (F), the mass of the object (m), and the object\u2019s acceleration (a), is simply stated using the equation\n\n$$\\[F = ma.\\]$$\n\nScientific ideas and explanations that are true in many, but not all situations in the universe are usually called principles. An example is Pascal\u2019s principle, which explains properties of liquids, but not solids or gases. However, the distinction between laws and principles is sometimes not carefully made in science.\n\nA theory is an explanation for patterns in nature that is supported by much scientific evidence and verified multiple times by multiple researchers. While many people confuse theories with educated guesses or hypotheses, theories have withstood more rigorous testing and verification than hypotheses.\n\nAs a closing idea about scientific processes, we want to point out that scientific laws and theories, even those that have been supported by experiments for centuries, can still be changed by new discoveries. This is especially true when new technologies emerge that allow us to observe things that were formerly unobservable. Imagine how viewing previously invisible objects with a microscope or viewing Earth for the first time from space may have instantly changed our scientific theories and laws! What discoveries still await us in the future? The constant retesting and perfecting of our scientific laws and theories allows our knowledge of nature to progress. For this reason, many scientists are reluctant to say that their studies prove anything. By saying support instead of prove, it keeps the door open for future discoveries, even if they won\u2019t occur for centuries or even millennia.",

These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool.

When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

These are called the base quantities for that system and their units are the system\u2019s base units. All other physical quantities can then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of these physical quantities is then known as a derived quantity and each unit is called a derived unit. The choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long as they are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived from them. Typically, the goal is to choose physical quantities that can be measured accurately to a high precision as the base quantities. The reason for this is simple. Since the derived units can be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base units, they can only be as accurate and precise as the base units from which they are derived.\n\nBased on such considerations, the International Standards Organization recommends using seven base quantities, which form the International System of Quantities (ISQ). These are the base quantities used to define the SI base units. lists these seven ISQ base quantities and the corresponding SI base units.",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinum-iridium bar. (The bar is now housed at the International Bureau of Weights and Meaures, near Paris). By 1960, some distances could be measured more precisely by comparing them to wavelengths of light. The meter was redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its present definition as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/ 299,792,458 of a second.",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

Exact replicas of the previously defined kilogram are also kept at the United States\u2019 National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, located in Gaithersburg, Maryland outside of Washington D.C., and at other locations around the world. The determination of all other masses could be ultimately traced to a comparison with the standard mass. Even though the platinum-iridium cylinder was resistant to corrosion, airborne contaminants were able to adhere to its surface, slightly changing its mass over time. In May 2019, the scientific community adopted a more stable definition of the kilogram. The kilogram is now defined in terms of the second, the meter, and Planck's constant, h (a quantum mechanical value that relates a photon's energy to its frequency).",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

However, the average solar day is actually very gradually getting longer due to gradual slowing of Earth\u2019s rotation. Accuracy in the fundamental units is essential, since all other measurements are derived from them. Therefore, a new standard was adopted to define the second in terms of a non-varying, or constant, physical phenomenon. One constant phenomenon is the very steady vibration of Cesium atoms, which can be observed and counted. This vibration forms the basis of the cesium atomic clock. In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 Cesium atom vibrations.",

Conveniently, the Kelvin scale actually changes in the same way as the Celsius scale. For example, the freezing point (0 \u00b0C) and boiling points of water (100 \u00b0C) are 100 degrees apart on the Celsius scale. These two temperatures are also 100 kelvins apart (freezing point = 273.15 K; boiling point = 373.15 K).",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

Yet the standard metric unit of length is the meter. So, the metric system includes many prefixes that can be attached to a unit. Each prefix is based on factors of 10 (10, 100, 1,000, etc., as well as 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, etc.). Table 1.2 gives the metric prefixes and symbols used to denote the different various factors of 10 in the metric system.\n\nThe metric system is convenient because conversions between metric units can be done simply by moving the decimal place of a number. This is because the metric prefixes are sequential powers of 10. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, 1000 meters in a kilometer, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as U.S. customary units, the relationships are less simple\u2014there are 12 inches in a foot, 5,280 feet in a mile, 4 quarts in a gallon, and so on. Another advantage of the metric system is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by switching to the most-appropriate metric prefix. For example, distances in meters are suitable for building construction, but kilometers are used to describe road construction. Therefore, with the metric system, there is no need to invent new units when measuring very small or very large objects\u2014you just have to move the decimal point (and use the appropriate prefix).",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

                    "context": "Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too large or small to be conveniently written as a decimal. For example, consider the number 840,000,000,000,000. It\u2019s a rather large number to write out. The scientific notation for this number is 8.40  $$\\(\\times\\)$$  1014. Scientific notation follows this general format\n\n$$\\[x~\\  \\times ~\\ 10^{y}.\\]$$\n\nIn this format x is the value of the measurement with all placeholder zeros removed. In the example above, x is 8.4. The x is multiplied by a factor, 10y, which indicates the number of placeholder zeros in the measurement. Placeholder zeros are those at the end of a number that is 10 or greater, and at the beginning of a decimal number that is less than 1. In the example above, the factor is 1014. This tells you that you should move the decimal point 14 positions to the right, filling in placeholder zeros as you go. In this case, moving the decimal point 14 places creates only 13 placeholder zeros, indicating that the actual measurement value is 840,000,000,000,000.\n\nNumbers that are fractions can be indicated by scientific notation as well. Consider the number 0.0000045. Its scientific notation is 4.5  $$\\(\\times\\)$$  10\u20136. Its scientific notation has the same format\n\n$$\\[x~\\  \\times ~\\ 10^{y}.\\]$$\n\nHere, x is 4.5. However, the value of y in the 10y factor is negative, which indicates that the measurement is a fraction of 1. Therefore, we move the decimal place to the left, for a negative y. In our example of 4.5  $$\\(\\times\\)$$  10\u20136, the decimal point would be moved to the left six times to yield the original number, which would be 0.0000045.\n\nThe term order of magnitude refers to the power of 10 when numbers are expressed in scientific notation. Quantities that have the same power of 10 when expressed in scientific notation, or come close to it, are said to be of the same order of magnitude. For example, the number 800 can be written as 8  $$\\(\\times\\)$$  102, and the number 450 can be written as 4.5  $$\\(\\times\\)$$  102. Both numbers have the same value for y. Therefore, 800 and 450 are of the same order of magnitude. Similarly, 101 and 99 would be regarded as the same order of magnitude, 102. Order of magnitude can be thought of as a ballpark estimate for the scale of a value. The diameter of an atom is on the order of 10\u22129 m, while the diameter of the sun is on the order of 109 m. These two values are 18 orders of magnitude apart.\n\nScientists make frequent use of scientific notation because of the vast range of physical measurements possible in the universe, such as the distance from Earth to the moon, or to the nearest star.",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

A doctor in the United States might convert a patient\u2019s weight in pounds to kilograms.\n\nLet\u2019s consider a simple example of how to convert units within the metric system. How can we convert 1 hour to seconds?\n\nFirst, we need to determine a conversion factor. A conversion factor is a ratio expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit. A conversion factor is simply a fraction which equals 1. You can multiply any number by 1 and get the same value. When you multiply a number by a conversion factor, you are simply multiplying it by one. For example, the following are conversion factors: (1 foot)/(12 inches) = 1 to convert inches to feet, (1 meter)/(100 centimeters) = 1 to convert centimeters to meters, (1 minute)/(60 seconds) = 1 to convert seconds to minutes.\n\nNow we can set up our unit conversion. We will write the units that we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor (1 km/1,000m) = 1, so we are simply multiplying 80m by 1:\n\n$$\\[\\text{1~}\\text{h}\\text{~\u00d7~}\\frac{\\text{60~}\\text{min}}{\\text{1~}\\text{h}}\\text{~\u00d7~}\\frac{\\text{60~s}}{\\text{1~}\\text{min}}\\text{=3600~s~=~3}\\text{.6~\u00d7~10}^{\\text{3}}\\text{~s}\\]$$\n\nWhen there is a unit in the original number, and a unit in the denominator (bottom) of the conversion factor, the units cancel. In this case, hours and minutes cancel and the value in seconds remains.\n\nYou can use this method to convert between any types of unit, including between the U.S. customary system and metric system. Notice also that, although you can multiply and divide units algebraically, you cannot add or subtract different units. An expression like 10 km + 5 kg makes no sense. Even adding two lengths in different units, such as 10 km + 20 m does not make sense. You express both lengths in the same unit. See Appendix C for a more complete list of conversion factors.",

The validity of a measurement can be described in terms of its accuracy and its precision (see Figure 1.19 and Figure 1.20). Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the correct value for that measurement. For example, let us say that you are measuring the length of standard piece of printer paper. The packaging in which you purchased the paper states that it is 11 inches long, and suppose this stated value is correct. You measure the length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 inches, 11.2 inches, and 10.9 inches. These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of 11.0 inches. In contrast, if you had obtained a measurement of 12 inches, your measurement would not be very accurate. This is why measuring instruments are calibrated based on a known measurement. If the instrument consistently returns the correct value of the known measurement, it is safe for use in finding unknown values.\n\nPrecision states how well repeated measurements of something generate the same or similar results. Therefore, the precision of measurements refers to how close together the measurements are when you measure the same thing several times. One way to analyze the precision of measurements would be to determine the range, or difference between the lowest and the highest measured values. In the case of the printer paper measurements, the lowest value was 10.9 inches and the highest value was 11.2 inches. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by, at most, 0.3 inches. These measurements were reasonably precise because they varied by only a fraction of an inch. However, if the measured values had been 10.9 inches, 11.1 inches, and 11.9 inches, then the measurements would not be very precise because there is a lot of variation from one measurement to another.\n\nThe measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let us consider a GPS system that is attempting to locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull\u2019s-eye target. Then think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot on the bull\u2019s eye.\n\nIn Figure 1.21, you can see that the GPS measurements are spread far apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low precision, high accuracy measuring system. However, in Figure 1.22, the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the target location. This indicates a high precision, low accuracy measuring system. Finally, in Figure 1.23, the GPS is both precise and accurate, allowing the restaurant to be located.",

                    "context": "The accuracy and precision of a measuring system determine the uncertainty of its measurements. Uncertainty is a way to describe how much your measured value deviates from the actual value that the object has. If your measurements are not very accurate or precise, then the uncertainty of your values will be very high. In more general terms, uncertainty can be thought of as a disclaimer for your measured values. For example, if someone asked you to provide the mileage on your car, you might say that it is 45,000 miles, plus or minus 500 miles. The plus or minus amount is the uncertainty in your value. That is, you are indicating that the actual mileage of your car might be as low as 44,500 miles or as high as 45,500 miles, or anywhere in between. All measurements contain some amount of uncertainty. In our example of measuring the length of the paper, we might say that the length of the paper is 11 inches plus or minus 0.2 inches or 11.0 \u00b1 0.2 inches. The uncertainty in a measurement, A, is often denoted as \u03b4A (\"delta A\"),\n\nThe factors contributing to uncertainty in a measurement include the following:\n\nLimitations of the measuring device The skill of the person making the measurement Irregularities in the object being measured Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation) \n\nIn the printer paper example uncertainty could be caused by: the fact that the smallest division on the ruler is 0.1 inches, the person using the ruler has bad eyesight, or uncertainty caused by the paper cutting machine (e.g., one side of the paper is slightly longer than the other.) It is good practice to carefully consider all possible sources of uncertainty in a measurement and reduce or eliminate them,",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

For example, the area of a floor calculated from measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the both the length and width have uncertainties. How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements in the calculation have small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the method of adding percents can be used. This method says that the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation. For example, if a floor has a length of 4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m, with uncertainties of 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, then the area of the floor is 12.0 m2 and has an uncertainty of 3 percent (expressed as an area this is 0.36 m2, which we round to 0.4 m2 since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter).\n\nFor more information on the accuracy, precision, and uncertainty of measurements based upon the units of measurement, visit this website.",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

                    "context": "An important factor in the accuracy and precision of measurements is the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, consider measuring the thickness of a coin. A standard ruler can measure thickness to the nearest millimeter, while a micrometer can measure the thickness to the nearest 0.005 millimeter. The micrometer is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in thickness. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be.\n\nWhen we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we initially measured with our measuring tool (such as the rulers shown in Figure 1.24). For example, if you use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, you may measure it with a decimeter ruler as 3.6 cm. You could not express this value as 3.65 cm because your measuring tool was not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices that the stick length seems to be somewhere in between 36 mm and 37 mm. He or she must estimate the value of the last digit. The rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. For example, the last measured value 36.5 mm has three digits, or three significant figures. The number of significant figures in a measurement indicates the precision of the measuring tool. The more precise a measuring tool is, the greater the number of significant figures it can report.",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

For example, the zeros in 0.053 are not significant because they are only placeholders that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053\u2014the 5 and the 3. However, if the zero occurs between other significant figures, the zeros are significant. For example, both zeros in 10.053 are significant, as these zeros were actually measured. Therefore, the 10.053 placeholder has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be significant, depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last zero, or the zeros could be placeholders. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, write 1300 in scientific notation as 1.3 \u00d7 103. Only significant figures are given in the x factor for a number in scientific notation (in the form  $$\\(x \\times 10^{y}\\)$$ ). Therefore, we know that 1 and 3 are the only significant digits in this number. In summary, zeros are significant except when they serve only as placeholders.

            "chapter_summary": "Physical quantities are a characteristic or property of an object that can be measured or calculated from other measurements. The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

                    "context": "When combining measurements with different degrees of accuracy and precision, the number of significant digits in the final answer can be no greater than the number of significant digits in the least precise measured value. There are two different rules, one for multiplication and division and another rule for addition and subtraction, as discussed below.\n\nFor multiplication and division: The answer should have the same number of significant figures as the starting value with the fewest significant figures. For example, the area of a circle can be calculated from its radius using  A=\u03c0r2A=\u03c0r2A=\u03c0r2 . Let us see how many significant figures the area will have if the radius has only two significant figures, for example, r = 2.0 m. Then, using a calculator that keeps eight significant figures, you would get$$\\[A = \\text{~\u03c0}r^{2} = \\ (3.1415927...)\\  \\times \\ \\left( {2.0\\;\\text{~m}} \\right)^{2} = \\ 4.5238934\\text{~m}^{2}.\\]$$But because the radius has only two significant figures, the area calculated is meaningful only to two significant figures or$$\\[A = \\ 4.5\\text{~m}^{2}\\]$$even though the value of  \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0  is meaningful to at least eight digits. For addition and subtraction: The answer should have the same number places (e.g. tens place, ones place, tenths place, etc.) as the least-precise starting value. Suppose that you buy 7.56 kg of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale having a precision of 0.01 kg. Then you drop off 6.052 kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with a precision of 0.001 kg. Finally, you go home and add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with a precision of 0.1 kg. How many kilograms of potatoes do you now have, and how many significant figures are appropriate in the answer? The mass is found by simple addition and subtraction:$$\\[\\begin{array}{l}\n\\underline{\\begin{aligned}\n7.56 & \\text{kg} \\\\\n-6.052 & \\text{kg} \\\\\n{+13.7} & \\text{kg} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}} \\\\\n\\begin{aligned}\n15.208 & \\text{kg} \\\\\n\\end{aligned} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$The least precise measurement is 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal place, so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer should be rounded to the tenths place, giving 15.2 kg. The same is true for non-decimal numbers. For example,$$\\[6527.23 + 2 = 6528.23 = 6528\\;\\text{.}\\]$$We cannot report the decimal places in the answer because 2 has no decimal places that would be significant. Therefore, we can only report to the ones place.It is a good idea to keep extra significant figures while calculating, and to round off to the correct number of significant figures only in the final answers. The reason is that small errors from rounding while calculating can sometimes produce significant errors in the final answer. As an example, try calculating  5,098\u2212(5.000)\u00d7(1,010)5,098\u2212(5.000)\u00d7(1,010)5,098\u2212(5.000)\u00d7(1,010)  to obtain a final answer to only two significant figures. Keeping all significant during the calculation gives 48. Rounding to two significant figures in the middle of the calculation changes it to  5,100\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(5.000)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(1,000)\u00a0=\u00a0100,5,100\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(5.000)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(1,000)\u00a0=\u00a0100,5,100\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(5.000)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(1,000)\u00a0=\u00a0100,  which is way off. You would similarly avoid rounding in the middle of the calculation in counting and in doing accounting, where many small numbers need to be added and subtracted accurately to give possibly much larger final numbers.

                    "context": "Most results in science are presented in scientific journal articles using graphs. Graphs present data in a way that is easy to visualize for humans in general, especially someone unfamiliar with what is being studied. They are also useful for presenting large amounts of data or data with complicated trends in an easily-readable way.\n\nOne commonly-used graph in physics and other sciences is the line graph, probably because it is the best graph for showing how one quantity changes in response to the other. Let\u2019s build a line graph based on the data in Table 1.5, which shows the measured distance that a train travels from its station versus time. Our two variables, or things that change along the graph, are time in minutes, and distance from the station, in kilometers. Remember that measured data may not have perfect accuracy.\n\nDraw the two axes. The horizontal axis, or x-axis, shows the independent variable, which is the variable that is controlled or manipulated. The vertical axis, or y-axis, shows the dependent variable, the non-manipulated variable that changes with (or is dependent on) the value of the independent variable. In the data above, time is the independent variable and should be plotted on the x-axis. Distance from the station is the dependent variable and should be plotted on the y-axis. Label each axes on the graph with the name of each variable, followed by the symbol for its units in parentheses. Be sure to leave room so that you can number each axis. In this example, use Time (min) as the label for the x-axis. Next, you must determine the best scale to use for numbering each axis. Because the time values on the x-axis are taken every 10 minutes, we could easily number the x-axis from 0 to 70 minutes with a tick mark every 10 minutes. Likewise, the y-axis scale should start low enough and continue high enough to include all of the distance from station values. A scale from 0 km to 160 km should suffice, perhaps with a tick mark every 10 km.In general, you want to pick a scale for both axes that 1) shows all of your data, and 2) makes it easy to identify trends in your data. If you make your scale too large, it will be harder to see how your data change. Likewise, the smaller and more fine you make your scale, the more space you will need to make the graph. The number of significant figures in the axis values should be coarser than the number of significant figures in the measurements. Now that your axes are ready, you can begin plotting your data. For the first data point, count along the x-axis until you find the 10 min tick mark. Then, count up from that point to the 10 km tick mark on the y-axis, and approximate where 22 km is along the y-axis. Place a dot at this location. Repeat for the other six data points.Figure 1.26 The graph of the train\u2019s distance from the station versus time from the exercise above. Add a title to the top of the graph to state what the graph is describing, such as the y-axis parameter vs. the x-axis parameter. In the graph shown here, the title is train motion. It could also be titled distance of the train from the station vs. time. Finally, with data points now on the graph, you should draw a trend line. The trend line represents the dependence you think the graph represents, so that the person who looks at your graph can see how close it is to the real data. In the present case, since the data points look like they ought to fall on a straight line, you would draw a straight line as the trend line. Draw it to come closest to all the points. Real data may have some inaccuracies, and the plotted points may not all fall on the trend line. In some cases, none of the data points fall exactly on the trend line.Figure 1.27 The completed graph with the trend line included. ",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

                    "context": "One way to get a quick snapshot of a dataset is to look at the equation of its trend line. If the graph produces a straight line, the equation of the trend line takes the form\n\n$$\\[y = mx + b\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThe b in the equation is the y-intercept while the m in the equation is the slope. The y-intercept tells you at what y value the line intersects the y-axis. In the case of the graph above, the y-intercept occurs at 0, at the very beginning of the graph. The y-intercept, therefore, lets you know immediately where on the y-axis the plot line begins.\n\nThe m in the equation is the slope. This value describes how much the line on the graph moves up or down on the y-axis along the line\u2019s length. The slope is found using the following equation\n\n$$\\[m = \\frac{Y_{2} - Y_{1}}{X_{2} - X_{1}}.\\]$$\n\nIn order to solve this equation, you need to pick two points on the line (preferably far apart on the line so the slope you calculate describes the line accurately). The quantities Y2 and Y1 represent the y-values from the two points on the line (not data points) that you picked, while X2 and X1 represent the two x-values of the those points.\n\nWhat can the slope value tell you about the graph? The slope of a perfectly horizontal line will equal zero, while the slope of a perfectly vertical line will be undefined because you cannot divide by zero. A positive slope indicates that the line moves up the y-axis as the x-value increases while a negative slope means that the line moves down the y-axis. The more negative or positive the slope is, the steeper the line moves up or down, respectively. The slope of our graph in Figure 1.26 is calculated below based on the two endpoints of the line\n\n$$\\[\\begin{matrix}\nm & = & \\frac{Y_{2} - Y_{1}}{X_{2} - X_{1}} \\\\\nm & = & \\frac{\\text{(80~km)~\u2013~(20~km)}}{\\text{(40~min)~\u2013~(10~min)}} \\\\\nm & = & \\frac{\\text{60~km}}{\\text{30~min}} \\\\\nm & = & {\\text{2}\\text{.0~km/min}\\text{.}} \\\\\n\\end{matrix}\\]$$\n\nEquation of line: $$\\(y = \\left( {2.0\\;\\text{~km/min}} \\right)x + 0\\)$$ \n\nBecause the x axis is time in minutes, we would actually be more likely to use the time t as the independent (x-axis) variable and write the equation as\n\n$$\\[y = \\left( {2.0\\;\\text{~km/min}} \\right)t + 0.\\]$$\n\nThe formula  $$\\(y = mx + b\\)$$  only applies to linear relationships, or ones that produce a straight line. Another common type of line in physics is the quadratic relationship, which occurs when one of the variables is squared. One quadratic relationship in physics is the relation between the speed of an object its centripetal acceleration, which is used to determine the force needed to keep an object moving in a circle. Another common relationship in physics is the inverse relationship, in which one variable decreases whenever the other variable increases. An example in physics is Coulomb\u2019s law. As the distance between two charged objects increases, the electrical force between the two charged objects decreases. Inverse proportionality, such the relation between x and y in the equation \n\n$$\\[y = k/x\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nfor some number k, is one particular kind of inverse relationship. A third commonly-seen relationship is the exponential relationship, in which a change in the independent variable produces a proportional change in the dependent variable. As the value of the dependent variable gets larger, its rate of growth also increases. For example, bacteria often reproduce at an exponential rate when grown under ideal conditions. As each generation passes, there are more and more bacteria to reproduce. As a result, the growth rate of the bacterial population increases every generation.",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

This presents a problem when you\u2019re trying to figure out the best scale to use for your graph\u2019s axes. One option is to use a logarithmic (log) scale. In a logarithmic scale, the value each mark labels is the previous mark\u2019s value multiplied by some constant. For a log base 10 scale, each mark labels a value that is 10 times the value of the mark before it. Therefore, a base 10 logarithmic scale would be numbered: 0, 10, 100, 1,000, etc. You can see how the logarithmic scale covers a much larger range of values than the corresponding linear scale, in which the marks would label the values 0, 10, 20, 30, and so on.\n\nIf you use a logarithmic scale on one axis of the graph and a linear scale on the other axis, you are using a semi-log plot. The Richter scale, which measures the strength of earthquakes, uses a semi-log plot. The degree of ground movement is plotted on a logarithmic scale against the assigned intensity level of the earthquake, which ranges linearly from 1-10 (Figure 1.29 (a)). \n\nIf a graph has both axes in a logarithmic scale, then it is referred to as a log-log plot. The relationship between the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation such as light is usually shown as a log-log plot (Figure 1.29 (b)). Log-log plots are also commonly used to describe exponential functions, such as radioactive decay.",

The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. ",

Everything from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. Even in inanimate objects, atoms are always moving.\n\nHow do you know something is moving? The location of an object at any particular time is its position. More precisely, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to Earth as a whole, while a professor\u2019s position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white board. In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth, as the reference frame. (See Figure 2.2.) Thus, you can only know how fast and in what direction an object's position is changing against a background of something else that is either not moving or moving with a known speed and direction. The reference frame is the coordinate system from which the positions of objects are described. \n\nYour classroom can be used as a reference frame. In the classroom, the walls are not moving. Your motion as you walk to the door, can be measured against the stationary background of the classroom walls. You can also tell if other things in the classroom are moving, such as your classmates entering the classroom or a book falling off a desk. You can also tell in what direction something is moving in the classroom. You might say, \u201cThe teacher is moving toward the door.\u201d Your reference frame allows you to determine not only that something is moving but also the direction of motion. \n\nYou could also serve as a reference frame for others\u2019 movement. If you remained seated as your classmates left the room, you would measure their movement away from your stationary location. If you and your classmates left the room together, then your perspective of their motion would be change. You, as the reference frame, would be moving in the same direction as your other moving classmates. As you will learn in the Snap Lab, your description of motion can be quite different when viewed from different reference frames.",

                    "context": "As we study the motion of objects, we must first be able to describe the object\u2019s position. Before your parent drives you to school, the car is sitting in your driveway. Your driveway is the starting position for the car. When you reach your high school, the car has changed position. Its new position is your school. \n\nPhysicists use variables to represent terms. We will use d to represent car\u2019s position. We will use a subscript to differentiate between the initial position, d0, and the final position, df. In addition, vectors, which we will discuss later, will be in bold or will have an arrow above the variable. Scalars will be italicized.\n\n        Now imagine driving from your house to a friend's house located several kilometers away. How far would you drive? The distance an object moves is the length of the path between its initial position and its final position. The distance you drive to your friend's house depends on your path. As shown in Figure 2.5, distance is different from the length of a straight line between two points. The distance you drive to your friend's house is probably longer than the straight line between the two houses.      \n\nWe often want to be more precise when we talk about position. The description of an object\u2019s motion often includes more than just the distance it moves. For instance, if it is a five kilometer drive to school, the distance traveled is 5 kilometers. After dropping you off at school and driving back home, your parent will have traveled a total distance of 10 kilometers. The car and your parent will end up in the same starting position in space. The net change in position of an object is its displacement, or  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{d}\\text{.}\\)$$ The Greek letter delta,  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\)$$, means change in.\n\nIf you are describing only your drive to school, then the distance traveled and the displacement are the same\u20145 kilometers. When you are describing the entire round trip, distance and displacement are different. When you describe distance, you only include the magnitude, the size or amount, of the distance traveled. However, when you describe the displacement, you take into account both the magnitude of the change in position and the direction of movement.\n\nIn our previous example, the car travels a total of 10 kilometers, but it drives five of those kilometers forward toward school and five of those kilometers back in the opposite direction. If we ascribe the forward direction a positive (+) and the opposite direction a negative (\u2013), then the two quantities will cancel each other out when added together.\n\nA quantity, such as distance, that has magnitude (i.e., how big or how much) but does not take into account direction is called a scalar. A quantity, such as displacement, that has both magnitude and direction is called a vector.\n\nHopefully you now understand the conceptual difference between distance and displacement. Understanding concepts is half the battle in physics. The other half is math. A stumbling block to new physics students is trying to wade through the math of physics while also trying to understand the associated concepts. This struggle may lead to misconceptions and answers that make no sense. Once the concept is mastered, the math is far less confusing.\n\nSo let\u2019s review and see if we can make sense of displacement in terms of numbers and equations. You can calculate an object's displacement by subtracting its original position, d0, from its final position df. In math terms that means\n\n$$\\[\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{f}} - \\mathbf{d}_{0}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nIf the final position is the same as the initial position, then  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{d} = 0\\)$$ .\n\nTo assign numbers and/or direction to these quantities, we need to define an axis with a positive and a negative direction. We also need to define an origin, or O. In Figure 2.6, the axis is in a straight line with home at zero and school in the positive direction. If we left home and drove the opposite way from school, motion would have been in the negative direction. We would have assigned it a negative value. In the round-trip drive, df and d0 were both at zero kilometers. In the one way trip to school, df was at 5 kilometers and d0 was at zero km. So,  $$\\(\\Delta\\mathbf{d}\\)$$  was 5 kilometers. ",

Questions such as, \u201cHow long does a foot race take?\u201d and \u201cWhat was the runner\u2019s speed?\u201d cannot be answered without an understanding of other concepts. In this section we will look at time, speed, and velocity to expand our understanding of motion.\n\nA description of how fast or slow an object moves is its speed. Speed is the rate at which an object changes its location. Like distance, speed is a scalar because it has a magnitude but not a direction. Because speed is a rate, it depends on the time interval of motion. You can calculate the elapsed time or the change in time,  $$\\(\\Delta t\\)$$, of motion as the difference between the ending time and the beginning time\n\n$$\\[\\Delta t = t_{\\text{f}} - t_{\\text{0}}.\\]$$\n\nThe SI unit of time is the second (s), and the SI unit of speed is meters per second (m/s), but sometimes kilometers per hour (km/h), miles per hour (mph) or other units of speed are used.\n\nWhen you describe an object's speed, you often describe the average over a time period. Average speed, vavg, is the distance traveled divided by the time during which the motion occurs.\n\n$$\\[v_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}\\]$$\n\nYou can, of course, rearrange the equation to solve for either distance or time\n\n$$\\[\\text{time~=~}\\frac{\\text{distance}}{v_{\\text{avg}}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\n$$\\[\\text{distance~=~}v_{\\text{avg}}\\text{~\u00d7~time}\\]$$\n\nSuppose, for example, a car travels 150 kilometers in 3.2 hours. Its average speed for the trip is\n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{ccl}\nv_{\\text{avg}} & = & \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\\\\n & = & \\frac{150\\;\\text{~km}}{3.2\\;\\text{~h}} \\\\\n & = & {47\\;\\text{~km/h.}} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nA car's speed would likely increase and decrease many times over a 3.2 hour trip. Its speed at a specific instant in time, however, is its instantaneous speed. A car's speedometer describes its instantaneous speed.",

We cannot tell from the average velocity whether the passenger stopped momentarily or backed up before he got to the back of the plane. To get more details, we must consider smaller segments of the trip over smaller time intervals such as those shown in Figure 2.9. If you consider infinitesimally small intervals, you can define instantaneous velocity, which is the velocity at a specific instant in time. Instantaneous velocity and average velocity are the same if the velocity is constant.\n\nEarlier, you have read that distance traveled can be different than the magnitude of displacement. In the same way, speed can be different than the magnitude of velocity. For example, you drive to a store and return home in half an hour. If your car\u2019s odometer shows the total distance traveled was 6 km, then your average speed was 12 km/h.

                    "context": "A graph, like a picture, is worth a thousand words. Graphs not only contain numerical information, they also reveal relationships between physical quantities. In this section, we will investigate kinematics by analyzing graphs of position over time.\n\nGraphs in this text have perpendicular axes, one horizontal and the other vertical. When two physical quantities are plotted against each other, the horizontal axis is usually considered the independent variable, and the vertical axis is the dependent variable. In algebra, you would have referred to the horizontal axis as the x-axis and the vertical axis as the y-axis. As in Figure 2.10, a straight-line graph has the general form  $$\\(y = mx + b\\)$$ .\n\nHere m is the slope, defined as the rise divided by the run (as seen in the figure) of the straight line. The letter b is the y-intercept which is the point at which the line crosses the vertical, y-axis. In terms of a physical situation in the real world, these quantities will take on a specific significance, as we will see below. (Figure 2.10.)\n\nIn physics, time is usually the independent variable. Other quantities, such as displacement, are said to depend upon it. A graph of position versus time, therefore, would have position on the vertical axis (dependent variable) and time on the horizontal axis (independent variable). In this case, to what would the slope and y-intercept refer? Let\u2019s look back at our original example when studying distance and displacement.\n\nThe drive to school was 5 km from home. Let\u2019s assume it took 10 minutes to make the drive and that your parent was driving at a constant velocity the whole time. The position versus time graph for this section of the trip would look like that shown in Figure 2.11.\n\nAs we said before, d0 = 0 because we call home our O and start calculating from there. In Figure 2.11, the line starts at d = 0, as well. This is the b in our equation for a straight line. Our initial position in a position versus time graph is always the place where the graph crosses the x-axis at t = 0. What is the slope? The rise is the change in position, (i.e., displacement) and the run is the change in time. This relationship can also be written\n\n$$\\[\\frac{\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{d}}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis relationship was how we defined average velocity. Therefore, the slope in a d versus t graph, is the average velocity.\n\nLet\u2019s look at another example. Figure 2.12 shows a graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on a very flat dry lake bed in Nevada.\n\nUsing the relationship between dependent and independent variables, we see that the slope in the graph in Figure 2.12 is average velocity, vavg and the intercept is displacement at time zero\u2014that is, d0. Substituting these symbols into y = mx + b gives \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{v}t + \\mathbf{d}_{0}\\]$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{d}_{0} + \\mathbf{v}t\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThus a graph of position versus time gives a general relationship among displacement, velocity, and time, as well as giving detailed numerical information about a specific situation. From the figure we can see that the car has a position of 400 m at t = 0 s, 650 m at t = 1.0 s, and so on. And we can learn about the object\u2019s velocity, as well.",

The graph in Figure 2.13 shows its motion as it is getting up to speed after starting at rest.

The slope of the curve becomes steeper as time progresses, showing that the velocity is increasing over time. The slope at any point on a position-versus-time graph is the instantaneous velocity at that point.

                    "context": "Earlier, we examined graphs of position versus time. Now, we are going to build on that information as we look at graphs of velocity vs. time. Velocity is the rate of change of displacement. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity; we will discuss acceleration more in another chapter. These concepts are all very interrelated.\n\nWhat can we learn about motion by looking at velocity vs. time graphs? Let\u2019s return to our drive to school, and look at a graph of position versus time as shown in Figure 2.15.\n\nWe assumed for our original calculation that your parent drove with a constant velocity to and from school. We now know that the car could not have gone from rest to a constant velocity without speeding up. So the actual graph would be curved on either end, but let\u2019s make the same approximation as we did then, anyway.\n\nLooking at this graph, and given what we learned, we can see that there are two distinct periods to the car\u2019s motion\u2014the way to school and the way back. The average velocity for the drive to school is 0.5 km/minute. We can see that the average velocity for the drive back is \u20130.5 km/minute. If we plot the data showing velocity versus time, we get another graph:\n\nWe can learn a few things. First, we can derive a v versus t graph from a d versus t graph. Second, if we have a straight-line position\u2013time graph that is positively or negatively sloped, it will yield a horizontal velocity graph. There are a few other interesting things to note. Just as we could use a position vs. time graph to determine velocity, we can use a velocity vs. time graph to determine position. We know that v = d/t. If we use a little algebra to re-arrange the equation, we see that d = v $$\\(\\times\\)$$ t. In Figure 2.16, we have velocity on the y-axis and time along the x-axis. Let\u2019s take just the first half of the motion. We get 0.5 km/minute  $$\\(\\times\\)$$  10 minutes. The units for minutes cancel each other, and we get 5 km, which is the displacement for the trip to school. If we calculate the same for the return trip, we get \u20135 km. If we add them together, we see that the net displacement for the whole trip is 0 km, which it should be because we started and ended at the same place.\n\nThe area under a velocity curve represents the displacement. The velocity curve also tells us whether the car is speeding up. In our earlier example, we stated that the velocity was constant. So, the car is not speeding up. Graphically, you can see that the slope of these two lines is 0. This slope tells us that the car is not speeding up, or accelerating. We will do more with this information in a later chapter. For now, just remember that the area under the graph and the slope are the two important parts of the graph. Just like we could define a linear equation for the motion in a position vs. time graph, we can also define one for a velocity vs. time graph. As we said, the slope equals the acceleration, a. And in this graph, the y-intercept is v0. Thus,  $$\\(\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}_{0} + \\mathbf{a}t\\)$$ .\n\nBut what if the velocity is not constant? Let\u2019s look back at our jet-car example. At the beginning of the motion, as the car is speeding up, we saw that its position is a curve, as shown in Figure 2.17.\n\nYou do not have to do this, but you could, theoretically, take the instantaneous velocity at each point on this graph. If you did, you would get Figure 2.18, which is just a straight line with a positive slope.\n\nAgain, if we take the slope of the velocity vs. time graph, we get the acceleration, the rate of change of the velocity. And, if we take the area under the slope, we get back to the displacement.",

Recall that each of these terms has a designated variable and SI unit of measurement as follows:\n\nTime: t, measured in seconds (s) Displacement: \u0394d, measured in meters (m) Velocity: v, measured in meters per second (m/s) Acceleration: a, measured in meters per second per second (m/s2, also called meters per second squared) Also note the following:\u0394 means change inThe subscript 0 refers to an initial value; sometimes subscript i is instead used to refer to initial value.The subscript f refers to final valueA bar over a symbol, such as  a\u00afa\u00afa\u00af, means average \n\nAcceleration is the change in velocity divided by a period of time during which the change occurs. The SI units of velocity are m/s and the SI units for time are s, so the SI units for acceleration are m/s2. Average acceleration is given by\n\n$$\\[\\overline{a} = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{v_{\\text{f}} - v_{0}}{t_{\\text{f}} - t_{0}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nAverage acceleration is distinguished from instantaneous acceleration, which is acceleration at a specific instant in time. The magnitude of acceleration is often not constant over time. For example, runners in a race accelerate at a greater rate in the first second of a race than during the following seconds. You do not need to know all the instantaneous accelerations at all times to calculate average acceleration. All you need to know is the change in velocity (i.e., the final velocity minus the initial velocity) and the change in time (i.e., the final time minus the initial time), as shown in the formula. Note that the average acceleration can be positive, negative, or zero. A negative acceleration is simply an acceleration in the negative direction.\n\nKeep in mind that although acceleration points in the same direction as the change in velocity, it is not always in the direction of the velocity itself. When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its velocity. In everyday language, this is called deceleration; but in physics, it is acceleration\u2014whose direction happens to be opposite that of the velocity. For now, let us assume that motion to the right along the x-axis is positive and motion to the left is negative.\n\nFigure 3.2 shows a car with positive acceleration in (a) and negative acceleration in (b). The arrows represent vectors showing both direction and magnitude of velocity and acceleration.\n\nVelocity and acceleration are both vector quantities. Recall that vectors have both magnitude and direction. An object traveling at a constant velocity\u2014therefore having no acceleration\u2014does accelerate if it changes direction. So, turning the steering wheel of a moving car makes the car accelerate because the velocity changes direction.",

                    "context": "We are studying concepts related to motion: time, displacement, velocity, and especially acceleration. We are only concerned with motion in one dimension. The kinematic equations apply to conditions of constant acceleration and show how these concepts are related. Constant acceleration is acceleration that does not change over time. The first kinematic equation relates displacement d, average velocity  $$\\(\\overline{v}\\)$$, and time t.\n\n$$\\[d = d_{0} + \\overline{v}t\\]$$\n\nThe initial displacement  $$\\(d_{0}\\)$$ is often 0, in which case the equation can be written as  $$\\(\\overline{v} = \\frac{d}{t}\\)$$\n\nThis equation says that average velocity is displacement per unit time. We will express velocity in meters per second. If we graph displacement versus time, as in Figure 3.6, the slope will be the velocity. Whenever a rate, such as velocity, is represented graphically, time is usually taken to be the independent variable and is plotted along the x axis.\n\nThe second kinematic equation, another expression for average velocity  $$\\(\\overline{v},\\)$$ is simply the initial velocity plus the final velocity divided by two.\n\n$$\\[\\overline{v} = \\frac{v_{0} + v_{\\text{f}}}{2}\\]$$\n\nNow we come to our main focus of this chapter; namely, the kinematic equations that describe motion with constant acceleration. In the third kinematic equation, acceleration is the rate at which velocity increases, so velocity at any point equals initial velocity plus acceleration multiplied by time\n\n$$\\[v = v_{0} + at\\ \\text{Also},\\text{if\\ we\\ start\\ from\\ rest\\ (}v_{0} = 0\\;\\text{),\\ we\\ can\\ write}\\ a = \\frac{v}{t}\\]$$\n\nNote that this third kinematic equation does not have displacement in it. Therefore, if you do not know the displacement and are not trying to solve for a displacement, this equation might be a good one to use.\n\nThe third kinematic equation is also represented by the graph in Figure 3.7.\n\nThe fourth kinematic equation shows how displacement is related to acceleration\n\n$$\\[d = d_{0} + v_{0}t + \\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nWhen starting at the origin,  $$\\(d_{0} = 0\\)$$  and, when starting from rest,  $$\\(v_{0} = 0\\)$$, in which case the equation can be written as\n\n$$\\[a = \\frac{2d}{t^{2}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis equation tells us that, for constant acceleration, the slope of a plot of 2d versus t2 is acceleration, as shown in Figure 3.8.\n\nThe fifth kinematic equation relates velocity, acceleration, and displacement\n\n$$\\[v^{2} = v_{0}^{2} + 2a\\left( {d - d_{0}} \\right)\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis equation is useful for when we do not know, or do not need to know, the time.\n\nWhen starting from rest, the fifth equation simplifies to\n\n$$\\[a = \\frac{v^{2}}{2d}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nAccording to this equation, a graph of velocity squared versus twice the displacement will have a slope equal to acceleration.\n\nNote that, in reality, knowns and unknowns will vary. Sometimes you will want to rearrange a kinematic equation so that the knowns are the values on the axes and the unknown is the slope. Sometimes the intercept will not be at the origin (0,0). This will happen when v0 or d0 is not zero. This will be the case when the object of interest is already in motion, or the motion begins at some point other than at the origin of the coordinate system.\n\nThe kinematic equations are applicable when you have constant acceleration.\n\n $$\\(d = d_{0} + \\overline{v}t\\)$$, or  $$\\(\\overline{v} = \\frac{d}{t}\\)$$  when d0 = 0  $$\\(\\overline{v} = \\frac{v_{0} + v_{\\text{f}}}{2}\\)$$   $$\\(v = v_{0} + at\\)$$, or  $$\\(a = \\frac{v}{t}\\)$$  when v0 = 0  $$\\(d = d_{0} + v_{0}t + \\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\\)$$, or  $$\\(a = \\frac{2d}{t^{2}}\\)$$  when d0 = 0 and v0 = 0  $$\\(v^{2} = v_{0}^{2} + 2a\\left( {d - d_{0}} \\right)\\)$$, or  $$\\(a = \\frac{2d}{t^{2}}\\)$$  when d0 = 0 and v0 = 0 ",

A certain amount of creativity and insight are required as well.\n\nExamine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved. It is vital to draw a simple sketch at the outset. Decide which direction is positive and note that on your sketch. Identify the knowns: Make a list of what information is given or can be inferred from the problem statement. Remember, not all given information will be in the form of a number with units in the problem. If something starts from rest, we know the initial velocity is zero. If something stops, we know the final velocity is zero. Identify the unknowns: Decide exactly what needs to be determined in the problem. Find an equation or set of equations that can help you solve the problem. Your list of knowns and unknowns can help here. For example, if time is not needed or not given, then the fifth kinematic equation, which does not include time, could be useful. Insert the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. This step produces the numerical answer; it also provides a check on units that can help you find errors. If the units of the answer are incorrect, then an error has been made. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? This final step is extremely important because the goal of physics is to accurately describe nature. To see if the answer is reasonable, check its magnitude, its sign, and its units. Are the significant figures correct? ",

A situation that gives constant acceleration is the acceleration of falling objects.

Although this value decreases slightly with increasing altitude, it may be assumed to be essentially constant. The value of 9.80 m/s2 is labeled g and is referred to as acceleration due to gravity. Gravity is the force that causes nonsupported objects to accelerate downward\u2014or, more precisely, toward the center of Earth. The magnitude of this force is called the weight of the object and is given by mg where m is the mass of the object (in kg). In places other than on Earth, such as the Moon or on other planets, g is not 9.80 m/s2, but takes on other values. When using g for the acceleration a in a kinematic equation, it is usually given a negative sign because the acceleration due to gravity is downward.",

Motion itself can be beautiful, such as a dolphin jumping out of the water, the flight of a bird, or the orbit of a satellite. The study of motion is called kinematics, but kinematics describes only the way objects move\u2014their velocity and their acceleration. Dynamics considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems. Newton\u2019s laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics. These laws describe the way objects speed up, slow down, stay in motion, and interact with other objects. They are also universal laws: they apply everywhere on Earth as well as in space.\n\nA force pushes or pulls an object. The object being moved by a force could be an inanimate object, a table, or an animate object, a person. The pushing or pulling may be done by a person, or even the gravitational pull of Earth. Forces have different magnitudes and directions; this means that some forces are stronger than others and can act in different directions. For example, a cannon exerts a strong force on the cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, a mosquito landing on your arm exerts only a small force on your arm.\n\nWhen multiple forces act on an object, the forces combine. Adding together all of the forces acting on an object gives the total force, or net force. An external force is a force that acts on an object within the system from outside the system. This type of force is different than an internal force, which acts between two objects that are both within the system. The net external force combines these two definitions; it is the total combined external force. We discuss further details about net force, external force, and net external force in the coming sections.\n\nIn mathematical terms, two forces acting in opposite directions have opposite signs (positive or negative). By convention, the negative sign is assigned to any movement to the left or downward. If two forces pushing in opposite directions are added together, the larger force will be somewhat canceled out by the smaller force pushing in the opposite direction. It is important to be consistent with your chosen coordinate system within a problem; for example, if negative values are assigned to the downward direction for velocity, then distance, force, and acceleration should also be designated as being negative in the downward direction.",

                    "context": "For our first example of force, consider an object hanging from a rope. This example gives us the opportunity to introduce a useful tool known as a free-body diagram. A free-body diagram represents the object being acted upon\u2014that is, the free body\u2014as a single point. Only the forces acting on the body (that is, external forces) are shown and are represented by vectors (which are drawn as arrows). These forces are the only ones shown because only external forces acting on the body affect its motion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body because they cancel each other out, as explained in the section on Newton\u2019s third law of motion. Free-body diagrams are very useful for analyzing forces acting on an object.\n\nFigure 4.2 shows the force of tension in the rope acting in the upward direction, opposite the force of gravity. The forces are indicated in the free-body diagram by an arrow pointing up, representing tension, and another arrow pointing down, representing gravity. In a free-body diagram, the lengths of the arrows show the relative magnitude (or strength) of the forces. Because forces are vectors, they add just like other vectors. Notice that the two arrows have equal lengths in Figure 4.2, which means that the forces of tension and weight are of equal magnitude. Because these forces of equal magnitude act in opposite directions, they are perfectly balanced, so they add together to give a net force of zero.\n\nNot all forces are as noticeable as when you push or pull on an object. Some forces act without physical contact, such as the pull of a magnet (in the case of magnetic force) or the gravitational pull of Earth (in the case of gravitational force).\n\nIn the next three sections discussing Newton\u2019s laws of motion, we will learn about three specific types of forces: friction, the normal force, and the gravitational force. To analyze situations involving forces, we will create free-body diagrams to organize the framework of the mathematics for each individual situation.",

                    "context": "Newton\u2019s first law considered bodies at rest or bodies in motion at a constant velocity. The other state of motion to consider is when an object is moving with a changing velocity, which means a change in the speed and/or the direction of motion. This type of motion is addressed by Newton\u2019s second law of motion, which states how force causes changes in motion. Newton\u2019s second law of motion is used to calculate what happens in situations involving forces and motion, and it shows the mathematical relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. Mathematically, the second law is most often written as\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{\\text{F}}_{\\text{net}} = m\\mathbf{\\text{a}}\\text{or}\\text{\u03a3}\\mathbf{\\text{F}} = m\\mathbf{\\text{a}}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere Fnet (or \u2211F) is the net external force, m is the mass of the system, and a is the acceleration. Note that Fnet and \u2211F are the same because the net external force is the sum of all the external forces acting on the system.\n\nFirst, what do we mean by a change in motion? A change in motion is simply a change in velocity: the speed of an object can become slower or faster, the direction in which the object is moving can change, or both of these variables may change. A change in velocity means, by definition, that an acceleration has occurred. Newton\u2019s first law says that only a nonzero net external force can cause a change in motion, so a net external force must cause an acceleration. Note that acceleration can refer to slowing down or to speeding up. Acceleration can also refer to a change in the direction of motion with no change in speed, because acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time it takes for that change to occur, and velocity is defined by speed and direction.\n\nFrom the equation $$\\(\\text{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\text{a},\\)$$ we see that force is directly proportional to both mass and acceleration, which makes sense. To accelerate two objects from rest to the same velocity, you would expect more force to be required to accelerate the more massive object. Likewise, for two objects of the same mass, applying a greater force to one would accelerate it to a greater velocity.\n\nNow, let\u2019s rearrange Newton\u2019s second law to solve for acceleration. We get\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{\\text{a}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{\\text{F}}_{\\text{net}}}{m}\\text{or}\\mathbf{\\text{a}} = \\frac{\\text{\u03a3}\\mathbf{\\text{F}}}{m}.\\]$$\n\nIn this form, we can see that acceleration is directly proportional to force, which we write as\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{\\text{a}} \\propto \\mathbf{\\text{F}}_{\\text{net}},\\]$$\n\nwhere the symbol $$\\(\\propto\\)$$ means proportional to. \n\nThis proportionality mathematically states what we just said in words: acceleration is directly proportional to the net external force. When two variables are directly proportional to each other, then if one variable doubles, the other variable must double. Likewise, if one variable is reduced by half, the other variable must also be reduced by half. In general, when one variable is multiplied by a number, the other variable is also multiplied by the same number. It seems reasonable that the acceleration of a system should be directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting on the system. An object experiences greater acceleration when acted on by a greater force.\n\nIt is also clear from the equation  $$\\(\\mathbf{a} = {\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}}\\text{/}m}\\)$$  that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass, which we write as\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{a}\\  \\propto \\ \\frac{1}{m}.\\]$$\n\nInversely proportional means that if one variable is multiplied by a number, the other variable must be divided by the same number. Now, it also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely proportional to the mass of the system. In other words, the larger the mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given force. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 4.5, which shows that a given net external force applied to a basketball produces a much greater acceleration than when applied to a car.",

                    "context": "Before putting Newton\u2019s second law into action, it is important to consider units.The equation $$\\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\mathbf{a}\\)$$ is used to define the units of force in terms of the three basic units of mass, length, and time (recall that acceleration has units of length divided by time squared). The SI unit of force is called the newton (abbreviated N) and is the force needed to accelerate a 1-kg system at the rate of 1 m/s2. That is, because  $$\\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\mathbf{a},\\)$$  we have\n\n$$\\[1\\;\\text{N} = 1\\;\\text{kg} \\times 1\\text{m/s}^{2} = 1\\frac{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}}{\\text{s}^{2}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nOne of the most important applications of Newton\u2019s second law is to calculate weight (also known as the gravitational force), which is usually represented mathematically as W. When people talk about gravity, they don\u2019t always realize that it is an acceleration. When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth. Newton\u2019s second law states that the net external force acting on an object is responsible for the acceleration of the object. If air resistance is negligible, the net external force on a falling object is only the gravitational force (i.e., the weight of the object).\n\nWeight can be represented by a vector because it has a direction. Down is defined as the direction in which gravity pulls, so weight is normally considered a downward force. By using Newton\u2019s second law, we can figure out the equation for weight.\n\nConsider an object with mass m falling toward Earth. It experiences only the force of gravity (i.e., the gravitational force or weight), which is represented by W. Newton\u2019s second law states that  $$\\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\mathbf{a}.\\)$$  Because the only force acting on the object is the gravitational force, we have  $$\\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\mathbf{W}.\\)$$  We know that the acceleration of an object due to gravity is g, so we have  $$\\(\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{g}.\\)$$  Substituting these two expressions into Newton\u2019s second law gives\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{\\text{W}} = m\\mathbf{\\text{g}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis is the equation for weight\u2014the gravitational force on a mass m. On Earth,  $$\\(\\mathbf{g} = 9.80\\text{~m/s}^{\\text{2}},\\)$$  so the weight (disregarding for now the direction of the weight) of a 1.0-kg object on Earth is\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{W} = m\\mathbf{g} = \\text{(1}\\text{.0~kg)(9}\\text{.80~m/s}^{\\text{2}}) = 9.8\\;\\text{~N.}\\]$$\n\nAlthough most of the world uses newtons as the unit of force, in the United States the most familiar unit of force is the pound (lb), where 1 N = 0.225 lb.\n\nRecall that although gravity acts downward, it can be assigned a positive or negative value, depending on what the positive direction is in your chosen coordinate system. Be sure to take this into consideration when solving problems with weight. When the downward direction is taken to be negative, as is often the case, acceleration due to gravity becomes g = \u22129.8 m/s2.\n\nWhen the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in freefall. In this case, the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity. On the surface of Earth, when objects fall downward toward Earth, they are never truly in freefall because there is always some upward force due to air resistance that acts on the object (and there is also the buoyancy force of air, which is similar to the buoyancy force in water that keeps boats afloat).\n\nGravity varies slightly over the surface of Earth, so the weight of an object depends very slightly on its location on Earth. Weight varies dramatically away from Earth\u2019s surface. On the moon, for example, the acceleration due to gravity is only 1.67 m/s2. Because weight depends on the force of gravity, a 1.0-kg mass weighs 9.8 N on Earth and only about 1.7 N on the moon.\n\nIt is important to remember that weight and mass are very different, although they are closely related. Mass is the quantity of matter (how much stuff) in an object and does not vary, but weight is the gravitational force on an object and is proportional to the force of gravity. It is easy to confuse the two, because our experience is confined to Earth, and the weight of an object is essentially the same no matter where you are on Earth. Adding to the confusion, the terms mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday language; for example, our medical records often show our weight in kilograms, but never in the correct unit of newtons.",

                    "context": "If you have ever stubbed your toe, you have noticed that although your toe initiates the impact, the surface that you stub it on exerts a force back on your toe. Although the first thought that crosses your mind is probably \u201couch, that hurt\u201d rather than \u201cthis is a great example of Newton\u2019s third law,\u201d both statements are true.\n\nThis is exactly what happens whenever one object exerts a force on another\u2014each object experiences a force that is the same strength as the force acting on the other object but that acts in the opposite direction. Everyday experiences, such as stubbing a toe or throwing a ball, are all perfect examples of Newton\u2019s third law in action.\n\nNewton\u2019s third law of motion states that whenever a first object exerts a force on a second object, the first object experiences a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.\n\nNewton\u2019s third law of motion tells us that forces always occur in pairs, and one object cannot exert a force on another without experiencing the same strength force in return. We sometimes refer to these force pairs as action-reaction pairs, where the force exerted is the action, and the force experienced in return is the reaction (although which is which depends on your point of view). \n\nNewton\u2019s third law is useful for figuring out which forces are external to a system. Recall that identifying external forces is important when setting up a problem, because the external forces must be added together to find the net force.\n\nWe can see Newton\u2019s third law at work by looking at how people move about. Consider a swimmer pushing off from the side of a pool, as illustrated in Figure 4.8. She pushes against the pool wall with her feet and accelerates in the direction opposite to her push. The wall has thus exerted on the swimmer a force of equal magnitude but in the direction opposite that of her push. You might think that two forces of equal magnitude but that act in opposite directions would cancel, but they do not because they act on different systems.\n\nIn this case, there are two different systems that we could choose to investigate: the swimmer or the wall. If we choose the swimmer to be the system of interest, as in the figure, then  $$\\(\\text{F}_{\\text{wall~on~feet}}\\)$$  is an external force on the swimmer and affects her motion. Because acceleration is in the same direction as the net external force, the swimmer moves in the direction of  $$\\(\\text{F}_{\\text{wall~on~feet}}.\\)$$ Because the swimmer is our system (or object of interest) and not the wall, we do not need to consider the force $$\\(\\text{F}_{\\text{feet~on~wall}}\\)$$ because it originates from the swimmer rather than acting on the swimmer. Therefore, $$\\(\\text{F}_{\\text{feet~on~wall}}\\)$$ does not directly affect the motion of the system and does not cancel $$\\(\\text{F}_{\\text{wall~on~feet}}.\\)$$ Note that the swimmer pushes in the direction opposite to the direction in which she wants to move.\n\nOther examples of Newton\u2019s third law are easy to find. As a teacher paces in front of a whiteboard, he exerts a force backward on the floor. The floor exerts a reaction force in the forward direction on the teacher that causes him to accelerate forward. Similarly, a car accelerates because the ground pushes forward on the car's wheels in reaction to the car's wheels pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road and throw rocks backward.\n\nAnother example is the force of a baseball as it makes contact with the bat. Helicopters create lift by pushing air down, creating an upward reaction force. Birds fly by exerting force on air in the direction opposite that in which they wish to fly. For example, the wings of a bird force air downward and backward in order to get lift and move forward. An octopus propels itself forward in the water by ejecting water backward through a funnel in its body, which is similar to how a jet ski is propelled. In these examples, the octopus or jet ski push the water backward, and the water, in turn, pushes the octopus or jet ski forward.",

                    "context": "Forces are classified and given names based on their source, how they are transmitted, or their effects. In previous sections, we discussed the forces called push, weight, and friction. In this section, applying Newton\u2019s third law of motion will allow us to explore three more forces: the normal force, tension, and thrust. However, because we haven\u2019t yet covered vectors in depth, we\u2019ll only consider one-dimensional situations in this chapter. Another chapter will consider forces acting in two dimensions.\n\nThe gravitational force (or weight) acts on objects at all times and everywhere on Earth. We know from Newton\u2019s second law that a net force produces an acceleration; so, why is everything not in a constant state of freefall toward the center of Earth? The answer is the normal force. The normal force is the force that a surface applies to an object to support the weight of that object; it acts perpendicular to the surface upon which the object rests. If an object on a flat surface is not accelerating, the net external force is zero, and the normal force has the same magnitude as the weight of the system but acts in the opposite direction. In equation form, we write that\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{N} = m\\mathbf{g}.\\]$$\n\nNote that this equation is only true for a horizontal surface.\n\nThe word tension comes from the Latin word meaning to stretch. Tension is the force along the length of a flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain, or cable. Regardless of the type of connector attached to the object of interest, one must remember that the connector can only pull (or exert tension) in the direction parallel to its length. Tension is a pull that acts parallel to the connector, and that acts in opposite directions at the two ends of the connector. This is possible because a flexible connector is simply a long series of action-reaction forces, except at the two ends where outside objects provide one member of the action-reaction forces.\n\nConsider a person holding a mass on a rope, as shown in Figure 4.9.\n\nTension in the rope must equal the weight of the supported mass, as we can prove by using Newton\u2019s second law. If the 5.00 kg mass in the figure is stationary, then its acceleration is zero, so $$\\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = 0.\\)$$ The only external forces acting on the mass are its weight W and the tension T supplied by the rope. Summing the external forces to find the net force, we obtain\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\mathbf{T} - \\mathbf{W} = 0,\\]$$\n\nwhere T and W are the magnitudes of the tension and weight, respectively, and their signs indicate direction, with up being positive. By substituting mg for Fnet and rearranging the equation, the tension equals the weight of the supported mass, just as you would expect\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{W} = m\\mathbf{g.}\\]$$\n\nFor a 5.00-kg mass (neglecting the mass of the rope), we see that \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{T} = m\\mathbf{g} = (5.00\\;\\text{~kg)(9}\\text{.80~m/s}^{2}) = 49.0\\;\\text{~N}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nAnother example of Newton\u2019s third law in action is thrust. Rockets move forward by expelling gas backward at a high velocity. This means that the rocket exerts a large force backward on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber, and the gas, in turn, exerts a large force forward on the rocket in response. This reaction force is called thrust.",

Motion that is forward, to the right, or upward is usually considered to be positive (+); and motion that is backward, to the left, or downward is usually considered to be negative (\u2212).\n\nIn two dimensions, a vector describes motion in two perpendicular directions, such as vertical and horizontal. For vertical and horizontal motion, each vector is made up of vertical and horizontal components. In a one-dimensional problem, one of the components simply has a value of zero. For two-dimensional vectors, we work with vectors by using a frame of reference such as a coordinate system. Just as with one-dimensional vectors, we graphically represent vectors with an arrow having a length proportional to the vector\u2019s magnitude and pointing in the direction that the vector points.\n\nFigure 5.2 shows a graphical representation of a vector; the total displacement for a person walking in a city. The person first walks nine blocks east and then five blocks north. Her total displacement does not match her path to her final destination. The displacement simply connects her starting point with her ending point using a straight line, which is the shortest distance. We use the notation that a boldface symbol, such as D, stands for a vector. Its magnitude is represented by the symbol in italics, D, and its direction is given by an angle represented by the symbol $$\\(\\theta.\\)$$ Note that her displacement would be the same if she had begun by first walking five blocks north and then walking nine blocks east.\n\nThe head-to-tail method is a graphical way to add vectors. The tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector, and the head (or tip) of a vector is the pointed end of the arrow. The following steps describe how to use the head-to-tail method for graphical vector addition.\n\nLet the x-axis represent the east-west direction. Using a ruler and protractor, draw an arrow to represent the first vector (nine blocks to the east), as shown in Figure 5.3(a).        Figure 5.3 The diagram shows a vector with a magnitude of nine units and a direction of 0\u00b0. Let the y-axis represent the north-south direction. Draw an arrow to represent the second vector (five blocks to the north). Place the tail of the second vector at the head of the first vector, as shown in Figure 5.4(b).        Figure 5.4 A vertical vector is added. If there are more than two vectors, continue to add the vectors head-to-tail as described in step 2. In this example, we have only two vectors, so we have finished placing arrows tip to tail. Draw an arrow from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector, as shown in Figure 5.5(c). This is the resultant, or the sum, of the vectors.        Figure 5.5 The diagram shows the resultant vector, a ruler, and protractor. To find the magnitude of the resultant, measure its length with a ruler. When we deal with vectors analytically in the next section, the magnitude will be calculated by using the Pythagorean theorem. To find the direction of the resultant, use a protractor to measure the angle it makes with the reference direction (in this case, the x-axis). When we deal with vectors analytically in the next section, the direction will be calculated by using trigonometry to find the angle. \n\nVector subtraction is done in the same way as vector addition with one small change. We add the first vector to the negative of the vector that needs to be subtracted. A negative vector has the same magnitude as the original vector, but points in the opposite direction (as shown in Figure 5.6). Subtracting the vector B from the vector A, which is written as A \u2212 B, is the same as A + (\u2212B). Since it does not matter in what order vectors are added, A \u2212 B is also equal to (\u2212B) + A. This is true for scalars as well as vectors. For example, 5 \u2013 2 = 5 + (\u22122) = (\u22122) + 5. \n\nGlobal angles are calculated in the counterclockwise direction. The clockwise direction is considered negative. For example, an angle of $$\\(30^{\\circ}\\)$$ south of west is the same as the global angle $$\\(210^{\\circ},\\)$$ which can also be expressed as $$\\(-150^{\\circ}\\)$$ from the positive x-axis.",

                    "context": "Now that we have the skills to work with vectors in two dimensions, we can apply vector addition to graphically determine the resultant vector, which represents the total force. Consider an example of force involving two ice skaters pushing a third as seen in Figure 5.7.\n\nIn problems where variables such as force are already known, the forces can be represented by making the length of the vectors proportional to the magnitudes of the forces. For this, you need to create a scale. For example, each centimeter of vector length could represent 50 N worth of force. Once you have the initial vectors drawn to scale, you can then use the head-to-tail method to draw the resultant vector. The length of the resultant can then be measured and converted back to the original units using the scale you created.\n\nYou can tell by looking at the vectors in the free-body diagram in Figure 5.7 that the two skaters are pushing on the third skater with equal-magnitude forces, since the length of their force vectors are the same. Note, however, that the forces are not equal because they act in different directions. If, for example, each force had a magnitude of 400 N, then we would find the magnitude of the total external force acting on the third skater by finding the magnitude of the resultant vector. Since the forces act at a right angle to one another, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. For a triangle with sides a, b, and c, the Pythagorean theorem tells us that\n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{l}\n{a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}} \\\\\n{c = \\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}.} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nApplying this theorem to the triangle made by F1, F2, and Ftot in Figure 5.7, we get \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{tot}}^{2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{F}_{1}^{2} + \\mathbf{F}_{1}^{2}},\\]$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{tot}} = \\sqrt{{(400~\\text{N})}^{2} + {(400~\\text{N})}^{2}} = 566~\\text{N.}\\]$$\n\nNote that, if the vectors were not at a right angle to each other  $$\\((90^{\\circ}\\)$$ to one another), we would not be able to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant vector. Another scenario where adding two-dimensional vectors is necessary is for velocity, where the direction may not be purely east-west or north-south, but some combination of these two directions. In the next section, we cover how to solve this type of problem analytically. For now let\u2019s consider the problem graphically.",

                    "context": "For the analytical method of vector addition and subtraction, we use some simple geometry and trigonometry, instead of using a ruler and protractor as we did for graphical methods. However, the graphical method will still come in handy to visualize the problem by drawing vectors using the head-to-tail method. The analytical method is more accurate than the graphical method, which is limited by the precision of the drawing. For a refresher on the definitions of the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle, see Figure 5.17.\n\nSince, by definition,  $$\\(\\text{cos}\\theta = x/h\\)$$, we can find the length x if we know h and  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  by using  $$\\(x = h\\text{cos}\\theta\\)$$ . Similarly, we can find the length of y by using  $$\\(y = h\\text{sin}\\theta\\)$$ . These trigonometric relationships are useful for adding vectors.\n\nWhen a vector acts in more than one dimension, it is useful to break it down into its x and y components. For a two-dimensional vector, a component is a piece of a vector that points in either the x- or y-direction. Every 2-d vector can be expressed as a sum of its x and y components.\n\nFor example, given a vector like $$\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)$$ in Figure 5.18, we may want to find what two perpendicular vectors, $$\\(\\mathbf{A}_{x}\\)$$ and $$\\(\\mathbf{A}_{y}\\)$$, add to produce it. In this example, $$\\(\\mathbf{A}_{x}\\)$$ and $$\\(\\mathbf{A}_{y}\\)$$ form a right triangle, meaning that the angle between them is 90 degrees. This is a common situation in physics and happens to be the least complicated situation trigonometrically.\n\n $$\\(\\mathbf{A}_{x}\\)$$ and $$\\(\\mathbf{A}_{y}\\)$$ are defined to be the components of $$\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)$$ along the x- and y-axes. The three vectors, $$\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)$$, $$\\(\\mathbf{A}_{x}\\)$$, and $$\\(\\mathbf{A}_{y}\\)$$, form a right triangle.\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{x}}~ + ~\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{y}}~ = ~\\mathbf{A}\\]$$\n\nIf the vector $$\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)$$ is known, then its magnitude $$\\(A\\)$$ (its length) and its angle $$\\(\\theta\\)$$ (its direction) are known. To find $$\\(A_{x}\\)$$ and $$\\(A_{y}\\)$$, its x- and y-components, we use the following relationships for a right triangle:\n\n$$\\[A_{x} = A\\text{cos}\\theta\\]$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\[A_{y} = A\\text{sin}{\\theta,}\\]$$\n\nwhere $$\\(A_{x}\\)$$ is the magnitude of A in the x-direction, $$\\(A_{y}\\)$$ is the magnitude of A in the y-direction, and $$\\(\\theta\\)$$ is the angle of the resultant with respect to the x-axis, as shown in Figure 5.19.\n\nSuppose, for example, that $$\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)$$ is the vector representing the total displacement of the person walking in a city, as illustrated in Figure 5.20.\n\nThen A = 10.3 blocks and  $$\\(\\theta = 29.1^{\\circ}\\)$$, so that \n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{ccl}\nA_{x} & = & {A\\text{cos}\\theta} \\\\\n & = & {(10.3\\;\\text{~blocks)(cos29}\\text{.1}^{\\circ})} \\\\\n & = & {(10.3\\;\\text{~blocks)(0}\\text{.874)}} \\\\\n & = & {\\text{9}\\text{.0~blocks.}} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nThis magnitude indicates that the walker has traveled 9 blocks to the east\u2014in other words, a 9-block eastward displacement. Similarly, \n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{ccl}\nA_{y} & = & {A\\text{sin}\\theta} \\\\\n & = & {(10.3\\;\\text{~blocks)(sin29}\\text{.1}^{\\circ})} \\\\\n & = & {(10.3\\;\\text{~blocks)(0}\\text{.846)}} \\\\\n & = & {\\text{5}\\text{.0~blocks,}} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nindicating that the walker has traveled 5 blocks to the north\u2014a 5-block northward displacement.",

                    "context": "Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown (projected) into the air. After the initial force that launches the object, it only experiences the force of gravity. The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory. As an object travels through the air, it encounters a frictional force that slows its motion called air resistance. Air resistance does significantly alter trajectory motion, but due to the difficulty in calculation, it is ignored in introductory physics.\n\nThe most important concept in projectile motion is that horizontal and vertical motions are independent, meaning that they don\u2019t influence one another. Figure 5.27 compares a cannonball in free fall (in blue) to a cannonball launched horizontally in projectile motion (in red). You can see that the cannonball in free fall falls at the same rate as the cannonball in projectile motion. Keep in mind that if the cannon launched the ball with any vertical component to the velocity, the vertical displacements would not line up perfectly.\n\nSince vertical and horizontal motions are independent, we can analyze them separately, along perpendicular axes. To do this, we separate projectile motion into the two components of its motion, one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical.\n\nWe\u2019ll call the horizontal axis the x-axis and the vertical axis the y-axis. For notation, d is the total displacement, and x and y are its components along the horizontal and vertical axes. The magnitudes of these vectors are x and y, as illustrated in Figure 5.28.\n\nAs usual, we use velocity, acceleration, and displacement to describe motion. We must also find the components of these variables along the x- and y-axes. The components of acceleration are then very simple ay = \u2013g = \u20139.80 m/s2. Note that this definition defines the upwards direction as positive. Because gravity is vertical, ax = 0. Both accelerations are constant, so we can use the kinematic equations. For review, the kinematic equations from a previous chapter are summarized in Table 5.1.\n\nWhere x is position, x0 is initial position, v is velocity, vavg is average velocity, t is time and a is acceleration.",

These axes are perpendicular, so  $$\\(A_{x} = A\\text{cos}\\theta\\)$$  and  $$\\(A_{y} = A\\text{sin}\\theta\\)$$ are used. The magnitudes of the displacement $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{s}}\\)$$ along x- and y-axes are called $$\\(x\\)$$ and $$\\(y.\\)$$ The magnitudes of the components of the velocity $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{v}}\\)$$ are $$\\(v_{x} = v\\cos\\theta\\)$$ and $$\\(v_{y} = v\\sin\\theta\\)$$, where $$\\(v\\)$$ is the magnitude of the velocity and $$\\(\\theta\\)$$ is its direction. Initial values are denoted with a subscript 0.         Treat the motion as two independent one-dimensional motions, one horizontal and the other vertical. The kinematic equations for horizontal and vertical motion take the following forms        $$\\[\\begin{array}{l}\n{\\text{Horizontal~Motion}(\\mathbf{a}_{x} = 0)} \\\\\n{x = x_{0} + v_{x}t} \\\\\n{v_{x} = v_{0x} = \\mathbf{\\text{v}}_{\\text{x}} = \\text{velocity~~is~a~constant.}} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$        Vertical motion (assuming positive is up $$\\(\\mathbf{a}_{y} = - \\mathbf{g} = - 9.80\\text{~m/s}^{2}\\)$$ )        $$\\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny & = & {y_{0} + \\frac{1}{2}(v_{0y} + v_{y})t} \\\\\nv_{y} & = & {v_{0y} - \\mathbf{g}t} \\\\\ny & = & {y_{0} + v_{0y}t - \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{g}t^{2}} \\\\\nv_{y}^{2} & = & {v_{0y}^{2} - 2g(y - y_{0})} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$ Solve for the unknowns in the two separate motions (one horizontal and one vertical). Note that the only common variable between the motions is time $$\\(t\\)$$ . The problem solving procedures here are the same as for one-dimensional kinematics. Recombine the two motions to find the total displacement $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{s}}\\)$$ and velocity $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{v}}\\)$$ . We can use the analytical method of vector addition, which uses $$\\(A = \\sqrt{A_{x}{}^{2} + A_{y}{}^{2}}\\)$$ and $$\\(\\theta = \\tan^{- 1}(A_{y}/A_{x})\\)$$ to find the magnitude and direction of the total displacement and velocity.    $$\\[\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Displacement} \\\\\n{\\mathbf{d} = \\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} \\\\\n{\\theta = \\tan^{- 1}(y/x)} \\\\\n\\text{Velocity} \\\\\n{\\mathbf{v} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{v}_{x}^{2} + \\mathbf{v}_{y}^{2}}} \\\\\n{\\theta_{v} = \\tan^{- 1}(\\mathbf{v}_{y}/\\mathbf{v}_{x})} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$ $$\\(\\theta\\)$$ is the direction of the displacement $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{d}}\\)$$, and $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{v}}\\)$$ is the direction of the velocity $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{v}}\\)$$ . (See Figure 5.29Figure 5.29 (a) We analyze two-dimensional projectile motion by breaking it into two independent one-dimensional motions along the vertical and horizontal axes. (b) The horizontal motion is simple, because \u00a0ax=0\u00a0ax=0\u00a0ax=0 and \u00a0vx\u00a0vx\u00a0vx is thus constant. (c) The velocity in the vertical direction begins to decrease as the object rises; at its highest point, the vertical velocity is zero. As the object falls towards the Earth again, the vertical velocity increases again in magnitude but points in the opposite direction to the initial vertical velocity. (d) The x- and y-motions are recombined to give the total velocity at any given point on the trajectory. \n\nThe expression we found for  $$\\(\\mathbf{y}\\)$$ while solving part (a) of the previous problem works for any projectile motion problem where air resistance is negligible. Call the maximum height  $$\\(\\mathbf{y} = h\\)$$; then,\n\n$$\\[h = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{0y}^{2}}{2\\mathbf{g}}.\\]$$\n\nThis equation defines the maximum height of a projectile. The maximum height depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity.",

                    "context": "Recall from the previous chapter that friction is a force that opposes motion, and is around us all the time. Friction allows us to move, which you have discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice.\n\nThere are different types of friction\u2014kinetic and static. Kinetic friction acts on an object in motion, while static friction acts on an object or system at rest. The maximum static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between the objects.\n\nImagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor. You may push harder and harder on the crate and not move it at all. This means that the static friction responds to what you do\u2014it increases to be equal to and in the opposite direction of your push. But if you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to move. Once in motion, it is easier to keep it in motion than it was to get it started because the kinetic friction force is less than the static friction force. If you were to add mass to the crate, (for example, by placing a box on top of it) you would need to push even harder to get it started and also to keep it moving. If, on the other hand, you oiled the concrete you would find it easier to get the crate started and keep it going.\n\nFigure 5.33 shows how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Magnifying these surfaces shows that they are rough on the microscopic level. So when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a crate), you must raise the object until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, break off the points, or do both. The harder the surfaces are pushed together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is needed to move them.\n\nThe magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static friction, the other for kinetic friction. When there is no motion between the objects, the magnitude of static friction fs is\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{s}} \\leq \\mu_{\\text{s}}\\mathbf{N}_{\\text{s}}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere $$\\(\\mu_{\\text{s}}\\)$$ is the coefficient of static friction and N is the magnitude of the normal force. Recall that the normal force opposes the force of gravity and acts perpendicular to the surface in this example, but not always.\n\nSince the symbol $$\\(\\leq\\)$$ means less than or equal to, this equation says that static friction can have a maximum value of $$\\(\\mu_{\\text{s}}\\mathbf{N}.\\)$$ That is,\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{s}}\\text{(max)} = \\mu_{\\text{s}}\\mathbf{N.}\\]$$\n\nStatic friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force exceeds fs(max), the object will move. Once an object is moving, the magnitude of kinetic friction fk is given by\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{k}} = \\mu_{\\text{k}}\\mathbf{N.}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(\\mu_{\\text{k}}\\)$$  is the coefficient of kinetic friction.\n\nFriction varies from surface to surface because different substances are rougher than others. Table 5.2 compares values of static and kinetic friction for different surfaces. The coefficient of the friction depends on the two surfaces that are in contact.\n\nSince the direction of friction is always opposite to the direction of motion, friction runs parallel to the surface between objects and perpendicular to the normal force. For example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the floor) has a mass of 100 kg, then the normal force would be equal to its weight\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{W} = m\\mathbf{g} = (100\\;\\text{kg})(9.80\\text{m/s}^{2}) = 980\\;\\text{~N},\\]$$\n\nperpendicular to the floor. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.45, you would have to exert a force parallel to the floor greater than\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{s}}\\text{(max)} = \\mu_{\\text{s}}\\mathbf{N} = (0.45)(980\\;\\text{~N)} = 440\\;\\text{~N}\\]$$\n\nto move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the coefficient of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a force of only 290 N \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{k}} = \\mu_{\\text{k}}\\mathbf{N} = (0.30)(980\\;\\text{~N)} = 290\\;\\text{~N}\\]$$\n\nwould keep it moving at a constant speed. If the floor were lubricated, both coefficients would be much smaller than they would be without lubrication. The coefficient of friction is unitless and is a number usually between 0 and 1.0. ",

                    "context": "We discussed previously that when an object rests on a horizontal surface, there is a normal force supporting it equal in magnitude to its weight. Up until now, we dealt only with normal force in one dimension, with gravity and normal force acting perpendicular to the surface in opposing directions (gravity downward, and normal force upward). Now that you have the skills to work with forces in two dimensions, we can explore what happens to weight and the normal force on a tilted surface such as an inclined plane. For inclined plane problems, it is easier breaking down the forces into their components if we rotate the coordinate system, as illustrated in Figure 5.34. The first step when setting up the problem is to break down the force of weight into components.\n\nWhen an object rests on an incline that makes an angle $$\\(\\theta\\)$$ with the horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the object is divided into two components: A force acting perpendicular to the plane, $$\\(\\mathbf{w}_{\\bot}\\)$$, and a force acting parallel to the plane, $$\\(\\mathbf{w}_{||}\\)$$ . The perpendicular force of weight, $$\\(\\mathbf{w}_{\\bot}\\)$$, is typically equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the normal force, $$\\(\\mathbf{N}.\\)$$ The force acting parallel to the plane, $$\\(\\mathbf{w}_{||}\\)$$, causes the object to accelerate down the incline. The force of friction, $$\\(\\mathbf{f}\\)$$, opposes the motion of the object, so it acts upward along the plane.\n\nIt is important to be careful when resolving the weight of the object into components. If the angle of the incline is at an angle $$\\(\\theta\\)$$ to the horizontal, then the magnitudes of the weight components are\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{w}_{||} = \\mathbf{w}sin(\\theta) = m\\mathbf{g}sin(\\theta)\\text{~and}\\]$$\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{w}_{\\bot} = \\mathbf{w}cos(\\theta) = m\\mathbf{g}cos(\\theta)\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nInstead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to be able to determine them from reason. To do this, draw the right triangle formed by the three weight vectors. Notice that the angle   of the incline is the same as the angle formed between $$\\(\\mathbf{w}\\)$$ and $$\\(\\mathbf{w}_{\\bot}\\)$$ . Knowing this property, you can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of the weight components\n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{l}\n{cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{w}_{\\bot}}{\\mathbf{w}}} \\\\\n{\\mathbf{w}_{\\bot} = \\mathbf{w}cos(\\theta) = m\\mathbf{g}cos(\\theta)} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{l}\n{sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{w}_{||}}{\\mathbf{w}}} \\\\\n{\\mathbf{w}_{||} = \\mathbf{w}sin(\\theta) = m\\mathbf{g}sin(\\theta)\\text{.}} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nTo review, the process for solving inclined plane problems is as follows:\n\nDraw a sketch of the problem. Identify known and unknown quantities, and identify the system of interest. Draw a free-body diagram (which is a sketch showing all of the forces acting on an object) with the coordinate system rotated at the same angle as the inclined plane. Resolve the vectors into horizontal and vertical components and draw them on the free-body diagram. Write Newton\u2019s second law in the horizontal and vertical directions and add the forces acting on the object. If the object does not accelerate in a particular direction (for example, the x -direction) then Fnet x = 0. If the object does accelerate in that direction, Fnet x = ma. Check your answer. Is the answer reasonable? Are the units correct? ",

A change in shape due to the application of a force is a deformation. Even very small forces are known to cause some deformation. For small deformations, two important things can happen. First, unlike the car and bulldozer example, the object returns to its original shape when the force is removed. Second, the size of the deformation is proportional to the force. This second property is known as Hooke\u2019s law. In equation form, Hooke\u2019s law is \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{F} = - \\mathbf{k{x,}}\\]$$\n\nwhere x is the amount of deformation (the change in length, for example) produced by the restoring force F, and k is a constant that depends on the shape and composition of the object. The restoring force is the force that brings the object back to its equilibrium position; the minus sign is there because the restoring force acts in the direction opposite to the displacement. Note that the restoring force is proportional to the deformation x. The deformation can also be thought of as a displacement from equilibrium. It is a change in position due to a force. In the absence of force, the object would rest at its equilibrium position. The force constant k is related to the stiffness of a system. The larger the force constant, the stiffer the system. A stiffer system is more difficult to deform and requires a greater restoring force. The units of k are newtons per meter (N/m). One of the most common uses of Hooke\u2019s law is solving problems involving springs and pendulums, which we will cover at the end of this section. ",

                    "context": "What do an ocean buoy, a child in a swing, a guitar, and the beating of hearts all have in common? They all oscillate. That is, they move back and forth between two points, like the ruler illustrated in Figure 5.37. All oscillations involve force. For example, you push a child in a swing to get the motion started.\n\nNewton\u2019s first law implies that an object oscillating back and forth is experiencing forces. Without force, the object would move in a straight line at a constant speed rather than oscillate. Consider, for example, plucking a plastic ruler to the left as shown in Figure 5.38. The deformation of the ruler creates a force in the opposite direction, known as a restoring force. Once released, the restoring force causes the ruler to move back toward its stable equilibrium position, where the net force on it is zero. However, by the time the ruler gets there, it gains momentum and continues to move to the right, producing the opposite deformation. It is then forced to the left, back through equilibrium, and the process is repeated until it gradually loses all of its energy. The simplest oscillations occur when the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement. Recall that Hooke\u2019s law describes this situation with the equation F = \u2212kx. Therefore, Hooke\u2019s law describes and applies to the simplest case of oscillation, known as simple harmonic motion.\n\nWhen you pluck a guitar string, the resulting sound has a steady tone and lasts a long time. Each vibration of the string takes the same time as the previous one. Periodic motion is a motion that repeats itself at regular time intervals, such as with an object bobbing up and down on a spring or a pendulum swinging back and forth. The time to complete one oscillation (a complete cycle of motion) remains constant and is called the period T. Its units are usually seconds. \n\nFrequency f is the number of oscillations per unit time. The SI unit for frequency is the hertz (Hz), defined as the number of oscillations per second. The relationship between frequency and period is\n\n$$\\[f = \\ 1/T\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nAs you can see from the equation, frequency and period are different ways of expressing the same concept. For example, if you get a paycheck twice a month, you could say that the frequency of payment is two per month, or that the period between checks is half a month.\n\nIf there is no friction to slow it down, then an object in simple motion will oscillate forever with equal displacement on either side of the equilibrium position. The equilibrium position is where the object would naturally rest in the absence of force. The maximum displacement from equilibrium is called the amplitude X. The units for amplitude and displacement are the same, but depend on the type of oscillation. For the object on the spring, shown in Figure 5.39, the units of amplitude and displacement are meters.\n\nThe mass m and the force constant k are the only factors that affect the period and frequency of simple harmonic motion. The period of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by\n\n$$\\[T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\mathbf{k}}}\\]$$\n\nand, because f = 1/T, the frequency of a simple harmonic oscillator is\n\n$$\\[f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathbf{k}}{m}}\\text{.}\\]$$",

                    "context": "Before solving problems with springs and pendulums, it is important to first get an understanding of how a pendulum works. Figure 5.40 provides a useful illustration of a simple pendulum.\n\nEveryday examples of pendulums include old-fashioned clocks, a child\u2019s swing, or the sinker on a fishing line. For small displacements of less than 15 degrees, a pendulum experiences simple harmonic oscillation, meaning that its restoring force is directly proportional to its displacement. A pendulum in simple harmonic motion is called a simple pendulum. A pendulum has an object with a small mass, also known as the pendulum bob, which hangs from a light wire or string. The equilibrium position for a pendulum is where the angle $$\\(\\theta\\)$$ is zero (that is, when the pendulum is hanging straight down). It makes sense that without any force applied, this is where the pendulum bob would rest.\n\nThe displacement of the pendulum bob is the arc length s. The weight mg has components mg cos $$\\(\\theta\\)$$ along the string and mg sin $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  tangent to the arc. Tension in the string exactly cancels the component mg cos $$\\(\\theta\\)$$ parallel to the string. This leaves a net restoring force back toward the equilibrium position that runs tangent to the arc and equals \u2212mg sin $$\\(\\theta\\)$$ .\n\nFor a simple pendulum, The period is $$\\(T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{\\mathbf{g}}}.\\)$$ \n\nThe only things that affect the period of a simple pendulum are its length and the acceleration due to gravity. The period is completely independent of other factors, such as mass or amplitude. However, note that T does depend on g. This means that if we know the length of a pendulum, we can actually use it to measure gravity! This will come in useful in Measuring Acceleration due to Gravity: The Period of a Pendulum.",

                    "context": "What exactly do we mean by circular motion or rotation? Rotational motion is the circular motion of an object about an axis of rotation. We will discuss specifically circular motion and spin. Circular motion is when an object moves in a circular path. Examples of circular motion include a race car speeding around a circular curve, a toy attached to a string swinging in a circle around your head, or the circular loop-the-loop on a roller coaster. Spin is rotation about an axis that goes through the center of mass of the object, such as Earth rotating on its axis, a wheel turning on its axle, the spin of a tornado on its path of destruction, or a figure skater spinning during a performance at the Olympics. Sometimes, objects will be spinning while in circular motion, like the Earth spinning on its axis while revolving around the Sun, but we will focus on these two motions separately.\n\nWhen solving problems involving rotational motion, we use variables that are similar to linear variables (distance, velocity, acceleration, and force) but take into account the curvature or rotation of the motion. Here, we define the angle of rotation, which is the angular equivalence of distance; and angular velocity, which is the angular equivalence of linear velocity.\n\nWhen objects rotate about some axis\u2014for example, when the CD in Figure 6.2 rotates about its center\u2014each point in the object follows a circular path. \n\nThe arc length,  , is the distance traveled along a circular path. The radius of curvature, r, is the radius of the circular path. Both are shown in Figure 6.3.\n\nConsider a line from the center of the CD to its edge. In a given time, each pit (used to record information) on this line moves through the same angle. The angle of rotation is the amount of rotation and is the angular analog of distance. The angle of rotation  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\theta\\)$$  is the arc length divided by the radius of curvature.\n\n$$\\[\\text{\u0394}\\theta = \\frac{\\text{\u0394}s}{r}\\]$$\n\nThe angle of rotation is often measured by using a unit called the radian. (Radians are actually dimensionless, because a radian is defined as the ratio of two distances, radius and arc length.) A revolution is one complete rotation, where every point on the circle returns to its original position.

                {
                    "context": "How fast is an object rotating? We can answer this question by using the concept of angular velocity. Consider first the angular speed  $$\\((\\omega)\\)$$  is the rate at which the angle of rotation changes. In equation form, the angular speed is\n\n$$\\[\\omega = \\frac{\\text{\u0394}\\theta}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhich means that an angular rotation  $$\\((\\Delta\\theta)\\)$$  occurs in a time,  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}t\\)$$ . If an object rotates through a greater angle of rotation in a given time, it has a greater angular speed. The units for angular speed are radians per second (rad/s).\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the direction of the angular speed, which means we now must call it the angular velocity. The direction of the angular velocity is along the axis of rotation. For an object rotating clockwise, the angular velocity points away from you along the axis of rotation. For an object rotating counterclockwise, the angular velocity points toward you along the axis of rotation.\n\nAngular velocity (\u03c9) is the angular version of linear velocity v. Tangential velocity is the instantaneous linear velocity of an object in rotational motion. To get the precise relationship between angular velocity and tangential velocity, consider again a pit on the rotating CD. This pit moves through an arc length  $$\\[(\\Delta s)\\]$$  in a short time  $$\\[(\\Delta t)\\]$$  so its tangential speed is\n\n$$\\[v = \\frac{\\text{\u0394}s}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nFrom the definition of the angle of rotation,  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\theta = \\frac{\\text{\u0394}s}{r}\\)$$, we see that  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}s = r\\text{\u0394}\\theta\\)$$ . Substituting this into the expression for v gives\n\n$$\\[v = \\frac{\\text{r}\\text{\u0394}\\theta}{\\text{\u0394}t} = r\\omega\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThe equation  $$\\(v = r\\omega\\)$$  says that the tangential speed v is proportional to the distance r from the center of rotation. Consequently, tangential speed is greater for a point on the outer edge of the CD (with larger r) than for a point closer to the center of the CD (with smaller r). This makes sense because a point farther out from the center has to cover a longer arc length in the same amount of time as a point closer to the center. Note that both points will still have the same angular speed, regardless of their distance from the center of rotation. See Figure 6.4.\n\nNow, consider another example: the tire of a moving car (see Figure 6.5). The faster the tire spins, the faster the car moves\u2014large  $$\\(\\omega\\)$$  means large v because  $$\\(v = r\\omega\\)$$ . Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity,  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\omega}\\)$$, will produce a greater linear (tangential) velocity, v, for the car. This is because a larger radius means a longer arc length must contact the road, so the car must move farther in the same amount of time.\n\nHowever, there are cases where linear velocity and tangential velocity are not equivalent, such as a car spinning its tires on ice. In this case, the linear velocity will be less than the tangential velocity. Due to the lack of friction under the tires of a car on ice, the arc length through which the tire treads move is greater than the linear distance through which the car moves. It\u2019s similar to running on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike; you are literally going nowhere fast.",

                    "context": "In the previous section, we defined circular motion. The simplest case of circular motion is uniform circular motion, where an object travels a circular path at a constant speed. Note that, unlike speed, the linear velocity of an object in circular motion is constantly changing because it is always changing direction. We know from kinematics that acceleration is a change in velocity, either in magnitude or in direction or both. Therefore, an object undergoing uniform circular motion is always accelerating, even though the magnitude of its velocity is constant.\n\nYou experience this acceleration yourself every time you ride in a car while it turns a corner. If you hold the steering wheel steady during the turn and move at a constant speed, you are executing uniform circular motion. What you notice is a feeling of sliding (or being flung, depending on the speed) away from the center of the turn. This isn\u2019t an actual force that is acting on you\u2014it only happens because your body wants to continue moving in a straight line (as per Newton\u2019s first law) whereas the car is turning off this straight-line path. Inside the car it appears as if you are forced away from the center of the turn. This fictitious force is known as the centrifugal force. The sharper the curve and the greater your speed, the more noticeable this effect becomes.\n\nFigure 6.7 shows an object moving in a circular path at constant speed. The direction of the instantaneous tangential velocity is shown at two points along the path. Acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity; in this case it points roughly toward the center of rotation. (The center of rotation is at the center of the circular path). If we imagine  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}s\\)$$  becoming smaller and smaller, then the acceleration would point exactly toward the center of rotation, but this case is hard to draw. We call the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion the centripetal acceleration ac because centripetal means center seeking.\n\nNow that we know that the direction of centripetal acceleration is toward the center of rotation, let\u2019s discuss the magnitude of centripetal acceleration. For an object traveling at speed v in a circular path with radius r, the magnitude of centripetal acceleration is\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{a}_{\\text{c}} = \\frac{v^{2}}{r}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nCentripetal acceleration is greater at high speeds and in sharp curves (smaller radius), as you may have noticed when driving a car, because the car actually pushes you toward the center of the turn. But it is a bit surprising that ac is proportional to the speed squared. This means, for example, that the acceleration is four times greater when you take a curve at 100 km/h than at 50 km/h. \n\nWe can also express ac in terms of the magnitude of angular velocity. Substituting  $$\\(v = r\\omega\\)$$  into the equation above, we get  $$\\(a_{c} = \\frac{{(r\\omega)}^{2}}{r} = r\\omega^{2}\\)$$ . Therefore, the magnitude of centripetal acceleration in terms of the magnitude of angular velocity is \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{a}_{c} = r\\omega^{2}.\\]$$",

Just a few examples are the tension in the rope on a tether ball, the force of Earth\u2019s gravity on the Moon, the friction between a road and the tires of a car as it goes around a curve, or the normal force of a roller coaster track on the cart during a loop-the-loop.\n\nAny net force causing uniform circular motion is called a centripetal force. The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of rotation, the same as for centripetal acceleration. According to Newton\u2019s second law of motion, a net force causes the acceleration of mass according to Fnet = ma. For uniform circular motion, the acceleration is centripetal acceleration: a = ac. Therefore, the magnitude of centripetal force, Fc, is  $$\\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{c}} = m\\mathbf{a}_{\\text{c}}\\)$$ .\n\nBy using the two different forms of the equation for the magnitude of centripetal acceleration,  $$\\(\\mathbf{a}_{\\text{c}} = {v^{2}/r}\\)$$  and  $$\\(\\mathbf{a}_{c} = r\\omega^{2}\\)$$, we get two expressions involving the magnitude of the centripetal force Fc. The first expression is in terms of tangential speed, the second is in terms of angular speed:  $$\\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{c}} = m\\frac{v^{2}}{r}\\)$$  and  $$\\(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{c}} = mr\\omega^{2}\\)$$ .\n\nBoth forms of the equation depend on mass, velocity, and the radius of the circular path. You may use whichever expression for centripetal force is more convenient. Newton\u2019s second law also states that the object will accelerate in the same direction as the net force. By definition, the centripetal force is directed towards the center of rotation, so the object will also accelerate towards the center. A straight line drawn from the circular path to the center of the circle will always be perpendicular to the tangential velocity. Note that, if you solve the first expression for r, you get\n\n$$\\[r = \\frac{mv^{2}}{\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{c}}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nFrom this expression, we see that, for a given mass and velocity, a large centripetal force causes a small radius of curvature\u2014that is, a tight curve.",

                    "context": "In the section on uniform circular motion, we discussed motion in a circle at constant speed and, therefore, constant angular velocity. However, there are times when angular velocity is not constant\u2014rotational motion can speed up, slow down, or reverse directions. Angular velocity is not constant when a spinning skater pulls in her arms, when a child pushes a merry-go-round to make it rotate, or when a CD slows to a halt when switched off. In all these cases, angular acceleration occurs because the angular velocity  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}\\)$$  changes. The faster the change occurs, the greater is the angular acceleration. Angular acceleration  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\)$$  is the rate of change of angular velocity. In equation form, angular acceleration is \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}} = \\frac{\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}\\)$$  is the change in angular velocity and  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}t\\)$$  is the change in time. The units of angular acceleration are (rad/s)/s, or rad/s2. If  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}\\)$$  increases, then  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\)$$  is positive. If  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}\\)$$  decreases, then  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\)$$  is negative. Keep in mind that, by convention, counterclockwise is the positive direction and clockwise is the negative direction. For example, the skater in Figure 6.9 is rotating counterclockwise as seen from above, so her angular velocity is positive. Acceleration would be negative, for example, when an object that is rotating counterclockwise slows down. It would be positive when an object that is rotating counterclockwise speeds up.\n\nThe relationship between the magnitudes of tangential acceleration, a, and angular acceleration,\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}},\\text{is}\\mathbf{a} = r\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\text{or}\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a}}{r}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThese equations mean that the magnitudes of tangential acceleration and angular acceleration are directly proportional to each other. The greater the angular acceleration, the larger the change in tangential acceleration, and vice versa. For example, consider riders in their pods on a Ferris wheel at rest. A Ferris wheel with greater angular acceleration will give the riders greater tangential acceleration because, as the Ferris wheel increases its rate of spinning, it also increases its tangential velocity. Note that the radius of the spinning object also matters. For example, for a given angular acceleration  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\)$$, a smaller Ferris wheel leads to a smaller tangential acceleration for the riders.\n\nSo far, we have defined three rotational variables:  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$,  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}\\)$$, and  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\)$$.  These are the angular versions of the linear variables x, v, and a. The following equations in the table represent the magnitude of the rotational variables and only when the radius is constant and perpendicular to the rotational variable. Table 6.2 shows how they are related.\n\nWe can now begin to see how rotational quantities like  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$,  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}\\)$$, and  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\)$$   are related to each other. For example, if a motorcycle wheel that starts at rest has a large angular acceleration for a fairly long time, it ends up spinning rapidly and rotates through many revolutions. Putting this in terms of the variables, if the wheel\u2019s angular acceleration  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\)$$  is large for a long period of time t, then the final angular velocity  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}\\)$$  and angle of rotation  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  are large. In the case of linear motion, if an object starts at rest and undergoes a large linear acceleration, then it has a large final velocity and will have traveled a large distance.\n\nThe kinematics of rotational motion describes the relationships between the angle of rotation, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and time. It only describes motion\u2014it does not include any forces or masses that may affect rotation (these are part of dynamics). Recall the kinematics equation for linear motion:  $$\\(\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}_{0} + \\mathbf{a}t\\)$$  (constant a).\n\nAs in linear kinematics, we assume a is constant, which means that angular acceleration  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\)$$  is also a constant, because  $$\\(\\mathbf{a} = r\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\)$$ . The equation for the kinematics relationship between  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}\\)$$,  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\)$$, and t is\n\n $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}} = \\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}_{0} + \\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}t(\\text{constant}\\text{\u03b1}),\\)$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}_{0}\\)$$  is the initial angular velocity. Notice that the equation is identical to the linear version, except with angular analogs of the linear variables. In fact, all of the linear kinematics equations have rotational analogs, which are given in Table 6.3. These equations can be used to solve rotational or linear kinematics problem in which a and  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03b1}}\\)$$  are constant.\n\nIn these equations,  $$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}_{0}\\)$$  and  $$\\(\\mathbf{v}_{0}\\)$$  are initial values,  $$\\(t_{0}\\)$$  is zero, and the average angular velocity  $$\\(\\overline{\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}}\\)$$  and average velocity  $$\\(\\overline{\\mathbf{v}}\\)$$  are \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{\\overline{\\text{\u03c9}}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}_{0} + \\mathbf{\\text{\u03c9}}}{2}\\text{and}\\overline{\\mathbf{v}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{0} + \\mathbf{v}}{2}\\text{.}\\]$$",

                    "context": "If you have ever spun a bike wheel or pushed a merry-go-round, you know that force is needed to change angular velocity. The farther the force is applied from the pivot point (or fulcrum), the greater the angular acceleration. For example, a door opens slowly if you push too close to its hinge, but opens easily if you push far from the hinges. Furthermore, we know that the more massive the door is, the more slowly it opens; this is because angular acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. These relationships are very similar to the relationships between force, mass, and acceleration from Newton\u2019s second law of motion. Since we have already covered the angular versions of distance, velocity and time, you may wonder what the angular version of force is, and how it relates to linear force.\n\nThe angular version of force is torque $$\\(\\mathbf{\\tau}\\)$$, which is the turning effectiveness of a force. See Figure 6.11. The equation for the magnitude of torque is \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{\\tau} = r\\mathbf{F}\\sin\\theta,\\]$$\n\nwhere r is the magnitude of the lever arm, F is the magnitude of the linear force, and  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  is the angle between the lever arm and the force. The lever arm is the vector from the point of rotation (pivot point or fulcrum) to the location where force is applied. Since the magnitude of the lever arm is a distance, its units are in meters, and torque has units of N\u22c5m. Torque is a vector quantity and has the same direction as the angular acceleration that it produces.\n\nApplying a stronger torque will produce a greater angular acceleration. For example, the harder the man pushes the merry-go-round in Figure 6.11, the faster it accelerates. Furthermore, the more massive the merry-go-round is, the slower it accelerates for the same torque. If the man wants to maximize the effect of his force on the merry-go-round, he should push as far from the center as possible to get the largest lever arm and, therefore, the greatest torque and angular acceleration. Torque is also maximized when the force is applied perpendicular to the lever arm.",

The moon\u2019s orbit around Earth has intrigued humans from time immemorial. The orbits of planets, asteroids, meteors, and comets around the sun are no less interesting. If we look farther, we see almost unimaginable numbers of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects orbiting one another and interacting through gravity. \n\nAll these motions are governed by gravitational force. The orbital motions of objects in our own solar system are simple enough to describe with a few fairly simple laws. The orbits of planets and moons satisfy the following two conditions:\n\nThe mass of the orbiting object, m, is small compared to the mass of the object it orbits, M. The system is isolated from other massive objects. \n\nBased on the motion of the planets about the sun, Kepler devised a set of three classical laws, called Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion, that describe the orbits of all bodies satisfying these two conditions:\n\nThe orbit of each planet around the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus. Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. The ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets about the sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their average distances from the sun. \n\nThese descriptive laws are named for the German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630). He devised them after careful study (over some 20 years) of a large amount of meticulously recorded observations of planetary motion done by Tycho Brahe (1546\u20131601). Such careful collection and detailed recording of methods and data are hallmarks of good science. Data constitute the evidence from which new interpretations and meanings can be constructed. Let\u2019s look closer at each of these laws.",

                    "context": "Sir Isaac Newton was the first scientist to precisely define the gravitational force, and to show that it could explain both falling bodies and astronomical motions. See Figure 7.7. But Newton was not the first to suspect that the same force caused both our weight and the motion of planets. His forerunner, Galileo Galilei, had contended that falling bodies and planetary motions had the same cause. Some of Newton\u2019s contemporaries, such as Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Edmund Halley, had also made some progress toward understanding gravitation. But Newton was the first to propose an exact mathematical form and to use that form to show that the motion of heavenly bodies should be conic sections\u2014circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. This theoretical prediction was a major triumph. It had been known for some time that moons, planets, and comets follow such paths, but no one had been able to propose an explanation of the mechanism that caused them to follow these paths and not others.\n\nThe gravitational force is relatively simple. It is always attractive, and it depends only on the masses involved and the distance between them. Expressed in modern language, Newton\u2019s universal law of gravitation states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directed along a line joining them. The force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This attraction is illustrated by Figure 7.8.\n\nFor two bodies having masses m and M with a distance r between their centers of mass, the equation for Newton\u2019s universal law of gravitation is\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{F} = G\\frac{mM}{r^{2}}\\]$$\n\nwhere F is the magnitude of the gravitational force and G is a proportionality factor called the gravitational constant. G is a universal constant, meaning that it is thought to be the same everywhere in the universe. It has been measured experimentally to be  $$\\(G = 6.673 \\times 10^{- 11}\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^{\\text{2}}\\text{/kg}^{\\text{2}}\\)$$ .\n\nIf a person has a mass of 60.0 kg, what would be the force of gravitational attraction on him at Earth\u2019s surface? G is given above, Earth\u2019s mass M is 5.97 \u00d7 1024 kg, and the radius r of Earth is 6.38 \u00d7 106 m. Putting these values into Newton\u2019s universal law of gravitation gives\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{F} = G\\frac{mM}{r^{2}} = \\left( {6.673 \\times 10^{- 11}\\frac{\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^{2}}{\\text{kg}^{2}}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{\\left( {60.0\\;\\text{~kg}} \\right)\\left( {5.97 \\times 10^{24}\\text{~kg}} \\right)}{\\left( {6.38 \\times 10^{6}\\text{~m}} \\right)^{2}} \\right) = 584\\;\\text{~N}\\]$$\n\nWe can check this result with the relationship:  $$\\(\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{g} = (60\\;\\text{kg})(9.8\\text{m/s}^{2}) = 588\\;\\text{N}\\)$$ \n\nYou may remember that g, the acceleration due to gravity, is another important constant related to gravity. By substituting g for a in the equation for Newton\u2019s second law of motion we get  $$\\(\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{g}\\)$$ . Combining this with the equation for universal gravitation gives\n\n$$\\[m\\mathbf{g} = G\\frac{mM}{r^{2}}\\]$$\n\nCancelling the mass m on both sides of the equation and filling in the values for the gravitational constant and mass and radius of the Earth, gives the value of g, which may look familiar.\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{g} = G\\frac{M}{r^{2}} = \\left( {6.67 \\times 10^{- 11}\\frac{\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^{2}}{\\text{kg}^{2}}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{5.98 \\times 10^{24}\\text{kg}}{\\left( {6.38 \\times 10^{6}\\text{m}} \\right)^{2}} \\right) = 9.80\\text{m/s}^{2}\\]$$\n\nThis is a good point to recall the difference between mass and weight. Mass is the amount of matter in an object; weight is the force of attraction between the mass within two objects. Weight can change because g is different on every moon and planet. An object\u2019s mass m does not change but its weight mg can.\n\nIt is possible to derive Kepler\u2019s third law from Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation. Applying Newton\u2019s second law of motion to angular motion gives an expression for centripetal force, which can be equated to the expression for force in the universal gravitation equation. This expression can be manipulated to produce the equation for Kepler\u2019s third law. We saw earlier that the expression r3/T2 is a constant for satellites orbiting the same massive object. The derivation of Kepler\u2019s third law from Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation and Newton\u2019s second law of motion yields that constant:\n\n$$\\[\\frac{r^{3}}{T^{2}} = \\frac{GM}{4\\pi^{2}}\\]$$\n\nwhere M is the mass of the central body about which the satellites orbit (for example, the sun in our solar system). The usefulness of this equation will be seen later.\n\nThe universal gravitational constant G is determined experimentally. This definition was first done accurately in 1798 by English scientist Henry Cavendish (1731\u20131810), more than 100 years after Newton published his universal law of gravitation. The measurement of G is very basic and important because it determines the strength of one of the four forces in nature. Cavendish\u2019s experiment was very difficult because he measured the tiny gravitational attraction between two ordinary-sized masses (tens of kilograms at most) by using an apparatus like that in Figure 7.9. Remarkably, his value for G differs by less than 1% from the modern value.",

                    "context": "Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity explained some interesting properties of gravity not covered by Newton\u2019s theory. Einstein based his theory on the postulate that acceleration and gravity have the same effect and cannot be distinguished from each other. He concluded that light must fall in both a gravitational field and in an accelerating reference frame. Figure 7.10 shows this effect (greatly exaggerated) in an accelerating elevator. In Figure 7.10 (a), the elevator accelerates upward in zero gravity. In Figure 7.10 (b), the room is not accelerating but is subject to gravity. The effect on light is the same: it \u201cfalls\u201d downward in both situations. The person in the elevator cannot tell whether the elevator is accelerating in zero gravity or is stationary and subject to gravity. Thus, gravity affects the path of light, even though we think of gravity as acting between masses, while photons are massless.\n\nEinstein\u2019s theory of general relativity got its first verification in 1919 when starlight passing near the sun was observed during a solar eclipse. (See Figure 7.11.) During an eclipse, the sky is darkened and we can briefly see stars. Those on a line of sight nearest the sun should have a shift in their apparent positions. Not only was this shift observed, but it agreed with Einstein\u2019s predictions well within experimental uncertainties. This discovery created a scientific and public sensation. Einstein was now a folk hero as well as a very great scientist. The bending of light by matter is equivalent to a bending of space itself, with light following the curve. This is another radical change in our concept of space and time. It is also another connection that any particle with mass or energy (e.g., massless photons) is affected by gravity.\n\nTo summarize the two views of gravity, Newton envisioned gravity as a tug of war along the line connecting any two objects in the universe. In contrast, Einstein envisioned gravity as a bending of space-time by mass.",

We can use this expression to compare weights of an object on different moons and planets.\n\nTwo equations involving the gravitational constant, G, are often useful. The first is Newton\u2019s equation,  $$\\(\\mathbf{F} = G\\frac{mM}{r^{2}}\\)$$ . Several of the values in this equation are either constants or easily obtainable. F is often the weight of an object on the surface of a large object with mass M, which is usually known. The mass of the smaller object, m, is often known, and G is a universal constant with the same value anywhere in the universe. This equation can be used to solve problems involving an object on or orbiting Earth or other massive celestial object. Sometimes it is helpful to equate the right-hand side of the equation to mg and cancel the m on both sides.\n\nThe equation  $$\\(\\frac{r^{3}}{T^{2}} = \\frac{GM}{4\\pi^{2}}\\)$$  is also useful for problems involving objects in orbit.

In equation form, linear momentum p is\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{p} = m\\mathbf{v}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nYou can see from the equation that momentum is directly proportional to the object\u2019s mass (m) and velocity (v). Therefore, the greater an object\u2019s mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum. A large, fast-moving object has greater momentum than a smaller, slower object. \n\nMomentum is a vector and has the same direction as velocity v. Since mass is a scalar, when velocity is in a negative direction (i.e., opposite the direction of motion), the momentum will also be in a negative direction; and when velocity is in a positive direction, momentum will likewise be in a positive direction. The SI unit for momentum is kg m/s.\n\nMomentum is so important for understanding motion that it was called the quantity of motion by physicists such as Newton. Force influences momentum, and we can rearrange Newton\u2019s second law of motion to show the relationship between force and momentum.\n\nRecall our study of Newton\u2019s second law of motion (Fnet = ma). Newton actually stated his second law of motion in terms of momentum: The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes. The change in momentum is the difference between the final and initial values of momentum.\n\nIn equation form, this law is\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{p}}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere Fnet is the net external force,  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{p}\\)$$  is the change in momentum, and  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}t\\)$$  is the change in time.\n\nWe can solve for  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{p}\\)$$  by rearranging the equation  \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{p}}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\]$$\n\nto be\n\n$$\\[\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{\\text{p}} = \\mathbf{\\text{F}}_{\\text{net}}\\text{\u0394}t\\text{.}\\]$$\n\n$$\\(\\mathbf{\\text{F}}_{\\text{net}}\\text{\u0394}t\\)$$is known as impulse and this equation is known as the impulse-momentum theorem. From the equation, we see that the impulse equals the average net external force multiplied by the time this force acts. It is equal to the change in momentum. The effect of a force on an object depends on how long it acts, as well as the strength of the force. Impulse is a useful concept because it quantifies the effect of a force. A very large force acting for a short time can have a great effect on the momentum of an object, such as the force of a racket hitting a tennis ball. A small force could cause the same change in momentum, but it would have to act for a much longer time. ",

                    "context": "It is important we realize that momentum is conserved during collisions, explosions, and other events involving objects in motion. To say that a quantity is conserved means that it is constant throughout the event. In the case of conservation of momentum, the total momentum in the system remains the same before and after the collision.\n\nYou may have noticed that momentum was not conserved in some of the examples previously presented in this chapter. where forces acting on the objects produced large changes in momentum. Why is this? The systems of interest considered in those problems were not inclusive enough. If the systems were expanded to include more objects, then momentum would in fact be conserved in those sample problems. It is always possible to find a larger system where momentum is conserved, even though momentum changes for individual objects within the system.\n\nFor example, if a football player runs into the goalpost in the end zone, a force will cause him to bounce backward. His momentum is obviously greatly changed, and considering only the football player, we would find that momentum is not conserved. However, the system can be expanded to contain the entire Earth. Surprisingly, Earth also recoils\u2014conserving momentum\u2014because of the force applied to it through the goalpost. The effect on Earth is not noticeable because it is so much more massive than the player, but the effect is real.\n\nNext, consider what happens if the masses of two colliding objects are more similar than the masses of a football player and Earth\u2014in the example shown in Figure 8.4 of one car bumping into another. Both cars are coasting in the same direction when the lead car, labeled m2, is bumped by the trailing car, labeled m1. The only unbalanced force on each car is the force of the collision, assuming that the effects due to friction are negligible. Car m1 slows down as a result of the collision, losing some momentum, while car m2 speeds up and gains some momentum. If we choose the system to include both cars and assume that friction is negligible, then the momentum of the two-car system should remain constant. Now we will prove that the total momentum of the two-car system does in fact remain constant, and is therefore conserved.\n\nUsing the impulse-momentum theorem, the change in momentum of car 1 is given by\n\n$$\\[\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{p}_{1} = \\mathbf{F}_{1}\\text{\u0394}t\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere F1 is the force on car 1 due to car 2, and  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}t\\)$$  is the time the force acts, or the duration of the collision.\n\nSimilarly, the change in momentum of car 2 is  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{p}_{2} = \\mathbf{F}_{2}\\text{\u0394}t\\)$$  where F2 is the force on car 2 due to car 1, and we assume the duration of the collision  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}t\\)$$  is the same for both cars. We know from Newton\u2019s third law of motion that F2 = \u2013F1, and so  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{p}_{2} = - \\mathbf{F}_{1}\\text{\u0394}t = - \\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{p}_{1}\\)$$ .\n\nTherefore, the changes in momentum are equal and opposite, and  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{p}_{1} + \\text{\u0394}\\mathbf{p}_{2} = 0\\)$$ .\n\nBecause the changes in momentum add to zero, the total momentum of the two-car system is constant. That is,\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{\\text{p}}_{1} + \\mathbf{\\text{p}}_{2} = \\text{constant}\\]$$\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{p}_{1} + \\mathbf{p}_{2} = \\mathbf{p^{\\prime}}_{1} + \\mathbf{p^{\\prime}}_{2}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere p\u20321 and p\u20322 are the momenta of cars 1 and 2 after the collision.\n\nThis result that momentum is conserved is true not only for this example involving the two cars, but for any system where the net external force is zero, which is known as an isolated system. The law of conservation of momentum states that for an isolated system with any number of objects in it, the total momentum is conserved. In equation form, the law of conservation of momentum for an isolated system is written as \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{\\text{p}}_{\\text{tot}} = \\text{constant}\\]$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{tot}} = \\mathbf{p^{\\prime}}_{\\text{tot}}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere ptot is the total momentum, or the sum of the momenta of the individual objects in the system at a given time, and p\u2032tot is the total momentum some time later.\n\nThe conservation of momentum principle can be applied to systems as diverse as a comet striking the Earth or a gas containing huge numbers of atoms and molecules. Conservation of momentum appears to be violated only when the net external force is not zero. But another larger system can always be considered in which momentum is conserved by simply including the source of the external force. For example, in the collision of two cars considered above, the two-car system conserves momentum while each one-car system does not.",

                    "context": "When objects collide, they can either stick together or bounce off one another, remaining separate. In this section, we\u2019ll cover these two different types of collisions, first in one dimension and then in two dimensions. \n\nIn an elastic collision, the objects separate after impact and don\u2019t lose any of their kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and is covered in detail elsewhere. The law of conservation of momentum is very useful here, and it can be used whenever the net external force on a system is zero. Figure 8.6 shows an elastic collision where momentum is conserved.\n\nAn animation of an elastic collision between balls can be seen by watching this video. It replicates the elastic collisions between balls of varying masses.\n\nPerfectly elastic collisions can happen only with subatomic particles. Everyday observable examples of perfectly elastic collisions don\u2019t exist\u2014some kinetic energy is always lost, as it is converted into heat transfer due to friction. However, collisions between everyday objects are almost perfectly elastic when they occur with objects and surfaces that are nearly frictionless, such as with two steel blocks on ice.\n\nNow, to solve problems involving one-dimensional elastic collisions between two objects, we can use the equation for conservation of momentum. First, the equation for conservation of momentum for two objects in a one-dimensional collision is\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{p}_{1} + \\mathbf{p}_{2} = \\mathbf{p}^{\\prime}{}_{1} + \\mathbf{p}^{\\prime}{}_{2}(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = 0)\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nSubstituting the definition of momentum p = mv for each initial and final momentum, we get\n\n$$\\[m_{1}\\mathbf{\\text{v}}_{1} + m_{2}\\mathbf{\\text{v}}_{2} = m_{1}{\\mathbf{\\text{v}}^{\\prime}}_{1} + m_{2}{\\mathbf{\\text{v}}^{\\prime}}_{2}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere the primes (') indicate values after the collision; In some texts, you may see i for initial (before collision) and f for final (after collision). The equation assumes that the mass of each object does not change during the collision.\n\nNow, let us turn to the second type of collision. An inelastic collision is one in which objects stick together after impact, and kinetic energy is not conserved. This lack of conservation means that the forces between colliding objects may convert kinetic energy to other forms of energy, such as potential energy or thermal energy. The concepts of energy are discussed more thoroughly elsewhere. For inelastic collisions, kinetic energy may be lost in the form of heat. Figure 8.7 shows an example of an inelastic collision. Two objects that have equal masses head toward each other at equal speeds and then stick together. The two objects come to rest after sticking together, conserving momentum but not kinetic energy after they collide. Some of the energy of motion gets converted to thermal energy, or heat.\n\nSince the two objects stick together after colliding, they move together at the same speed. This lets us simplify the conservation of momentum equation from\n\n$$\\[m_{1}\\mathbf{\\text{v}}_{1} + m_{2}\\mathbf{\\text{v}}_{2} = m_{1}{\\mathbf{\\text{v}}^{\\prime}}_{1} + m_{2}{\\mathbf{\\text{v}}^{\\prime}}_{2}\\]$$\n\nto\n\n$$\\[m_{1}\\mathbf{\\text{v}}_{1} + m_{2}\\mathbf{\\text{v}}_{2} = \\ \\left( {m_{1} + m_{2}} \\right)\\mathbf{\\text{v}}^{\\prime}\\]$$\n\nfor inelastic collisions, where v\u2032 is the final velocity for both objects as they are stuck together, either in motion or at rest.",

In one-dimensional collisions, the incoming and outgoing velocities are all along the same line. But what about collisions, such as those between billiard balls, in which objects scatter to the side? These are two-dimensional collisions, and just as we did with two-dimensional forces, we will solve these problems by first choosing a coordinate system and separating the motion into its x and y components.\n\nOne complication with two-dimensional collisions is that the objects might rotate before or after their collision. For example, if two ice skaters hook arms as they pass each other, they will spin in circles. We will not consider such rotation until later, and so for now, we arrange things so that no rotation is possible. To avoid rotation, we consider only the scattering of point masses\u2014that is, structureless particles that cannot rotate or spin.\n\nWe start by assuming that Fnet = 0, so that momentum p is conserved. The simplest collision is one in which one of the particles is initially at rest. The best choice for a coordinate system is one with an axis parallel to the velocity of the incoming particle, as shown in Figure 8.8. Because momentum is conserved, the components of momentum along the x- and y-axes, displayed as px and py, will also be conserved. With the chosen coordinate system, py is initially zero and px is the momentum of the incoming particle.\n\nNow, we will take the conservation of momentum equation, p1 + p2 = p\u20321 + p\u20322  and break it into its x and y components.\n\nAlong the x-axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{1x}} + \\mathbf{p}_{\\text{2x}} = \\mathbf{p}^{\\prime}{}_{\\text{1x}} + \\mathbf{p}^{\\prime}{}_{\\text{2x}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nIn terms of masses and velocities, this equation is\n\n$$\\[m_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1\\;\\text{x}} + m_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2\\;\\text{x}} = m_{1}{\\mathbf{v}^{\\prime}}_{1\\;\\text{x}} + m_{2}{\\mathbf{v}^{\\prime}}_{2\\;\\text{x}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nBut because particle 2 is initially at rest, this equation becomes\n\n$$\\[m_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1\\;\\text{x}} = m_{1}{\\mathbf{v}^{\\prime}}_{1\\;\\text{x}} + m_{2}{\\mathbf{v}^{\\prime}}_{2\\;\\text{x}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThe components of the velocities along the x-axis have the form v cos \u03b8 . Because particle 1 initially moves along the x-axis, we find v1x = v1. Conservation of momentum along the x-axis gives the equation\n\n$$\\[m_{1}\\mathbf{\\text{v}}_{1} = m_{1}{\\mathbf{\\text{v}}^{\\prime}}_{1}\\cos\\theta_{1} + m_{2}{\\mathbf{\\text{v}}^{\\prime}}_{2}\\cos\\theta_{2}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere $$\\(\\theta_{1}\\)$$ and $$\\(\\theta_{2}\\)$$ are as shown in Figure 8.8.\n\nAlong the y-axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{p}_{1\\;\\text{y}} + \\mathbf{p}_{2\\;\\text{y}} = {\\mathbf{p}^{\\prime}}_{1\\;\\text{y}} + {\\mathbf{p}^{\\prime}}_{2\\;\\text{y}}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\[m_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1\\;\\text{y}} + m_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2\\;\\text{y}} = m_{1}{\\mathbf{v}^{\\prime}}_{1\\;\\text{y}} + m_{2}{\\mathbf{v}^{\\prime}}_{2\\;\\text{y}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nBut v1y is zero, because particle 1 initially moves along the x-axis. Because particle 2 is initially at rest, v2y is also zero. The equation for conservation of momentum along the y-axis becomes\n\n$$\\[0\\;\\  = m_{1}{\\mathbf{v}^{\\prime}}_{1}y + m_{2}{\\mathbf{v}^{\\prime}}_{2}y\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThe components of the velocities along the y-axis have the form v sin  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$ .

                    "context": "In physics, the term work has a very specific definition. Work is application of force,  $$\\(\\mathbf{f}\\)$$, to move an object over a distance, d, in the direction that the force is applied. Work, W, is described by the equation\n\n$$\\[W = \\mathbf{f}d\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nSome things that we typically consider to be work are not work in the scientific sense of the term. Let\u2019s consider a few examples. Think about why each of the following statements is true.\n\nHomework is not work. Lifting a rock upwards off the ground is work. Carrying a rock in a straight path across the lawn at a constant speed is not work. \n\nThe first two examples are fairly simple. Homework is not work because objects are not being moved over a distance. Lifting a rock up off the ground is work because the rock is moving in the direction that force is applied. The last example is less obvious. Recall from the laws of motion that force is not required to move an object at constant velocity. Therefore, while some force may be applied to keep the rock up off the ground, no net force is applied to keep the rock moving forward at constant velocity.\n\nWork and energy are closely related. When you do work to move an object, you change the object\u2019s energy. You (or an object) also expend energy to do work. In fact, energy can be defined as the ability to do work. Energy can take a variety of different forms, and one form of energy can transform to another. In this chapter we will be concerned with mechanical energy, which comes in two forms: kinetic energy and potential energy.\n\nKinetic energy is also called energy of motion. A moving object has kinetic energy. Potential energy, sometimes called stored energy, comes in several forms. Gravitational potential energy is the stored energy an object has as a result of its position above Earth\u2019s surface (or another object in space). A roller coaster car at the top of a hill has gravitational potential energy. \n\nLet\u2019s examine how doing work on an object changes the object\u2019s energy. If we apply force to lift a rock off the ground, we increase the rock\u2019s potential energy, PE. If we drop the rock, the force of gravity increases the rock\u2019s kinetic energy as the rock moves downward until it hits the ground.\n\nThe force we exert to lift the rock is equal to its weight, w, which is equal to its mass, m, multiplied by acceleration due to gravity, g.\n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{f} = w = m\\mathbf{g}\\]$$\n\nThe work we do on the rock equals the force we exert multiplied by the distance, d, that we lift the rock. The work we do on the rock also equals the rock\u2019s gain in gravitational potential energy, PEe.\n\n$$\\[W = PE_{e} = m\\mathbf{g}\\mathbf{d}\\]$$\n\nKinetic energy depends on the mass of an object and its velocity, v.\n\n$$\\[KE = \\frac{1}{2}m\\mathbf{v}^{2}\\]$$\n\nWhen we drop the rock the force of gravity causes the rock to fall, giving the rock kinetic energy. When work done on an object increases only its kinetic energy, then the net work equals the change in the value of the quantity $$\\(\\frac{1}{2}m\\mathbf{v}^{2}\\)$$ . This is a statement of the work\u2013energy theorem, which is expressed mathematically as\n\n$$\\[W = \\text{\u0394}KE\\text{~=~}\\frac{1}{2}m\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}m\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{2}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThe subscripts 2 and 1 indicate the final and initial velocity, respectively. This theorem was proposed and successfully tested by James Joule, shown in Figure 9.2.\n\nDoes the name Joule sound familiar? The joule (J) is the metric unit of measurement for both work and energy. The measurement of work and energy with the same unit reinforces the idea that work and energy are related and can be converted into one another. 1.0 J = 1.0 N\u2219m, the units of force multiplied by distance. 1.0 N = 1.0 kg\u2219m/s2, so 1.0 J = 1.0 kg\u2219m2/s2. Analyzing the units of the term (1/2)mv2 will produce the same units for joules.",

                    "context": "In applications that involve work, we are often interested in how fast the work is done. For example, in roller coaster design, the amount of time it takes to lift a roller coaster car to the top of the first hill is an important consideration. Taking a half hour on the ascent will surely irritate riders and decrease ticket sales. Let\u2019s take a look at how to calculate the time it takes to do work.\n\nRecall that a rate can be used to describe a quantity, such as work, over a period of time. Power is the rate at which work is done. In this case, rate means per unit of time. Power is calculated by dividing the work done by the time it took to do the work.\n\n$$\\[P = \\frac{W}{t}\\]$$\n\nLet\u2019s consider an example that can help illustrate the differences among work, force, and power. Suppose the woman in Figure 9.3 lifting the TV with a pulley gets the TV to the fourth floor in two minutes, and the man carrying the TV up the stairs takes five minutes to arrive at the same place. They have done the same amount of work  $$\\(\\left( {\\mathbf{f}d} \\right)\\)$$  on the TV, because they have moved the same mass over the same vertical distance, which requires the same amount of upward force. However, the woman using the pulley has generated more power. This is because she did the work in a shorter amount of time, so the denominator of the power formula, t, is smaller. (For simplicity\u2019s sake, we will leave aside for now the fact that the man climbing the stairs has also done work on himself.)\n\nPower can be expressed in units of watts (W). This unit can be used to measure power related to any form of energy or work. You have most likely heard the term used in relation to electrical devices, especially light bulbs. Multiplying power by time gives the amount of energy. Electricity is sold in kilowatt-hours because that equals the amount of electrical energy consumed.\n\nThe watt unit was named after James Watt (1736\u20131819) (see Figure 9.4). He was a Scottish engineer and inventor who discovered how to coax more power out of steam engines.\n\nBefore proceeding, be sure you understand the distinctions among force, work, energy, and power. Force exerted on an object over a distance does work. Work can increase energy, and energy can do work. Power is the rate at which work is done.",

                    "context": "We saw earlier that mechanical energy can be either potential or kinetic. In this section we will see how energy is transformed from one of these forms to the other. We will also see that, in a closed system, the sum of these forms of energy remains constant.\n\nQuite a bit of potential energy is gained by a roller coaster car and its passengers when they are raised to the top of the first hill. Remember that the potential part of the term means that energy has been stored and can be used at another time. You will see that this stored energy can either be used to do work or can be transformed into kinetic energy. For example, when an object that has gravitational potential energy falls, its energy is converted to kinetic energy. Remember that both work and energy are expressed in joules.\n\nRefer back to Figure 9.3. The amount of work required to raise the TV from point A to point B is equal to the amount of gravitational potential energy the TV gains from its height above the ground. This is generally true for any object raised above the ground. If all the work done on an object is used to raise the object above the ground, the amount work equals the object\u2019s gain in gravitational potential energy. However, note that because of the work done by friction, these energy\u2013work transformations are never perfect. Friction causes the loss of some useful energy. In the discussions to follow, we will use the approximation that transformations are frictionless.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the roller coaster in Figure 9.7. Work was done on the roller coaster to get it to the top of the first rise; at this point, the roller coaster has gravitational potential energy. It is moving slowly, so it also has a small amount of kinetic energy. As the car descends the first slope, its PE is converted to KE. At the low point much of the original PE has been transformed to KE, and speed is at a maximum. As the car moves up the next slope, some of the KE is transformed back into PE and the car slows down.\n\nOn an actual roller coaster, there are many ups and downs, and each of these is accompanied by transitions between kinetic and potential energy. Assume that no energy is lost to friction. At any point in the ride, the total mechanical energy is the same, and it is equal to the energy the car had at the top of the first rise. This is a result of the law of conservation of energy, which says that, in a closed system, total energy is conserved\u2014that is, it is constant. Using subscripts 1 and 2 to represent initial and final energy, this law is expressed as\n\n$$\\[KE_{1} + PE_{1} = KE_{2} + PE_{2}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nEither side equals the total mechanical energy. The phrase in a closed system means we are assuming no energy is lost to the surroundings due to friction and air resistance. If we are making calculations on dense falling objects, this is a good assumption. For the roller coaster, this assumption introduces some inaccuracy to the calculation.",

                    "context": "Simple machines make work easier, but they do not decrease the amount of work you have to do. Why can\u2019t simple machines change the amount of work that you do? Recall that in closed systems the total amount of energy is conserved. A machine cannot increase the amount of energy you put into it. So, why is a simple machine useful? Although it cannot change the amount of work you do, a simple machine can change the amount of force you must apply to an object, and the distance over which you apply the force. In most cases, a simple machine is used to reduce the amount of force you must exert to do work. The down side is that you must exert the force over a greater distance, because the product of force and distance, fd, (which equals work) does not change.\n\nLet\u2019s examine how this works in practice. In Figure 9.8(a), the worker uses a type of lever to exert a small force over a large distance, while the pry bar pulls up on the nail with a large force over a small distance. Figure 9.8(b) shows the how a lever works mathematically. The effort force, applied at Fe, lifts the load (the resistance force) which is pushing down at Fr. The triangular pivot is called the fulcrum; the part of the lever between the fulcrum and Fe is the effort arm, Le; and the part to the left is the resistance arm, Lr. The mechanical advantage is a number that tells us how many times a simple machine multiplies the effort force. The ideal mechanical advantage, IMA, is the mechanical advantage of a perfect machine with no loss of useful work caused by friction between moving parts. The equation for IMA is shown in Figure 9.8(b).\n\nIn general, the IMA = the resistance force, Fr, divided by the effort force, Fe. IMA also equals the distance over which the effort is applied, de, divided by the distance the load travels, dr.\n\n$$\\[IMA = \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{r}}{\\mathbf{F}_{e}} = \\frac{d_{e}}{d_{r}}\\]$$\n\nGetting back to conservation of energy, for any simple machine, the work put into the machine, Wi, equals the work the machine puts out, Wo. Combining this with the information in the paragraphs above, we can write \n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{l}\n{W_{i} = W_{o}} \\\\\n{\\mathbf{F}_{e}d_{e} = \\mathbf{F}_{r}d_{r}} \\\\\n{\\text{If~~}\\mathbf{F}_{e} < \\mathbf{F}_{r}\\text{,~then~}d_{e} > d_{r}\\text{.}} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nThe equations show how a simple machine can output the same amount of work while reducing the amount of effort force by increasing the distance over which the effort force is applied.\n\nSome levers exert a large force to a short effort arm. This results in a smaller force acting over a greater distance at the end of the resistance arm. Examples of this type of lever are baseball bats, hammers, and golf clubs. In another type of lever, the fulcrum is at the end of the lever and the load is in the middle, as in the design of a wheelbarrow.\n\nThe simple machine shown in Figure 9.9 is called a wheel and axle. It is actually a form of lever. The difference is that the effort arm can rotate in a complete circle around the fulcrum, which is the center of the axle. Force applied to the outside of the wheel causes a greater force to be applied to the rope that is wrapped around the axle. As shown in the figure, the ideal mechanical advantage is calculated by dividing the radius of the wheel by the radius of the axle. Any crank-operated device is an example of a wheel and axle.\n\nAn inclined plane and a wedge are two forms of the same simple machine. A wedge is simply two inclined planes back to back. Figure 9.10 shows the simple formulas for calculating the IMAs of these machines. All sloping, paved surfaces for walking or driving are inclined planes. Knives and axe heads are examples of wedges.\n\nThe screw shown in Figure 9.11 is actually a lever attached to a circular inclined plane. Wood screws (of course) are also examples of screws. The lever part of these screws is a screw driver. In the formula for IMA, the distance between screw threads is called pitch and has the symbol P. \n\nFigure 9.12 shows three different pulley systems. Of all simple machines, mechanical advantage is easiest to calculate for pulleys. Simply count the number of ropes supporting the load. That is the IMA. Once again we have to exert force over a longer distance to multiply force. To raise a load 1 meter with a pulley system you have to pull N meters of rope. Pulley systems are often used to raise flags and window blinds and are part of the mechanism of construction cranes.\n\nA complex machine is a combination of two or more simple machines. The wire cutters in Figure 9.13 combine two levers and two wedges. Bicycles include wheel and axles, levers, screws, and pulleys. Cars and other vehicles are combinations of many machines.",

                    "context": "Relativity is not new. Way back around the year 1600, Galileo explained that motion is relative. Wherever you happen to be, it seems like you are at a fixed point and that everything moves with respect to you. Everyone else feels the same way. Motion is always measured with respect to a fixed point. This is called establishing a frame of reference. But the choice of the point is arbitrary, and all frames of reference are equally valid. A passenger in a moving car is not moving with respect to the driver, but they are both moving from the point of view of a person on the sidewalk waiting for a bus. They are moving even faster as seen by a person in a car coming toward them. It is all relative.\n\nLight is involved in the discussion of relativity because theories related to electromagnetism are inconsistent with Galileo\u2019s and Newton\u2019s explanation of relativity. The true nature of light was a hot topic of discussion and controversy in the late 19th century. At the time, it was not generally believed that light could travel across empty space. It was known to travel as waves, and all other types of energy that propagated as waves needed to travel though a material medium. It was believed that space was filled with an invisible medium that light waves traveled through. This imaginary (as it turned out) material was called the ether (also spelled aether). It was thought that everything moved through this mysterious fluid. In other words, ether was the one fixed frame of reference. The Michelson\u2013Morley experiment proved it was not.\n\nIn 1887, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley designed the interferometer shown in Figure 10.2 to measure the speed of Earth through the ether. A light beam is split into two perpendicular paths and then recombined. Recombining the waves produces an inference pattern, with a bright fringe at the locations where the two waves arrive in phase; that is, with the crests of both waves arriving together and the troughs arriving together. A dark fringe appears where the crest of one wave coincides with a trough of the other, so that the two cancel. If Earth is traveling through the ether as it orbits the sun, the peaks in one arm would take longer than in the other to reach the same location. The places where the two waves arrive in phase would change, and the interference pattern would shift. But, using the interferometer, there was no shift seen! This result led to two conclusions: that there is no ether and that the speed of light is the same regardless of the relative motion of source and observer. The Michelson\u2013Morley investigation has been called the most famous failed experiment in history.\n\nTo see what Michelson and Morley expected to find when they measured the speed of light in two directions, watch this animation. In the video, two people swimming in a lake are represented as an analogy to light beams leaving Earth as it moves through the ether (if there were any ether). The swimmers swim away from and back to a platform that is moving through the water. The swimmers swim in different directions with respect to the motion of the platform. Even though they swim equal distances at the same speed, the motion of the platform causes them to arrive at different times.",

                    "context": "The results described above left physicists with some puzzling and unsettling questions such as, why doesn\u2019t light emitted by a fast-moving object travel faster than light from a street lamp? A radical new theory was needed, and Albert Einstein, shown in Figure 10.3, was about to become everyone\u2019s favorite genius. Einstein began with two simple postulates based on the two things we have discussed so far in this chapter. \n\nThe laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. The speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames and is not affected by the speed of its source.  \n\nThe speed of light is given the symbol c and is equal to exactly 299,792,458 m/s. This is the speed of light in vacuum; that is, in the absence of air. For most purposes, we round this number off to  $$\\(3.00\\  \\times \\ 10^{8}\\text{~m/s}\\)$$  The term inertial reference frame simply refers to a frame of reference where all objects follow Newton\u2019s first law of motion: Objects at rest remain at rest, and objects in motion remain in motion at a constant velocity in a straight line, unless acted upon by an external force. The inside of a car moving along a road at constant velocity and the inside of a stationary house are inertial reference frames.\n\nEinstein\u2019s postulates were carefully chosen, and they both seemed very likely to be true. Einstein proceeded despite realizing that these two ideas taken together and applied to extreme conditions led to results that contradict Newtonian mechanics. He just took the ball and ran with it. \n\nIn the traditional view, velocities are additive. If you are running at 3 m/s and you throw a ball forward at a speed of 10 m/s, the ball should have a net speed of 13 m/s. However, according to relativity theory, the speed of a moving light source is not added to the speed of the emitted light.\n\nIn addition, Einstein\u2019s theory shows that if you were moving forward relative to Earth at nearly c (the speed of light) and could throw a ball forward at c, an observer at rest on the earth would not see the ball moving at nearly twice the speed of light. The observer would see it moving at a speed that is still less than c. This result conforms to both of Einstein\u2019s postulates: The speed of light has a fixed maximum and neither reference frame is privileged.\n\nConsider how we measure elapsed time. If we use a stopwatch, for example, how do we know when to start and stop the watch? One method is to use the arrival of light from the event, such as observing a light turn green to start a drag race. The timing will be more accurate if some sort of electronic detection is used, avoiding human reaction times and other complications.\n\nNow suppose we use this method to measure the time interval between two flashes of light produced by flash lamps on a moving train. (See Figure 10.4) \n\nA woman (observer A) is seated in the center of a rail car, with two flash lamps at opposite sides equidistant from her. Multiple light rays that are emitted from the flash lamps move towards observer A, as shown with arrows. A velocity vector arrow for the rail car is shown towards the right. A man (observer B) standing on the platform is facing the woman and also observes the flashes of light.\n\nObserver A moves with the lamps on the rail car as the rail car moves towards the right of observer B. Observer B receives the light flashes simultaneously, and sees the bulbs as both having flashed at the same time. However, he sees observer A receive the flash from the right first. Because the pulse from the right reaches her first, in her frame of reference she sees the bulbs as not having flashed simultaneously. Here, a relative velocity between observers affects whether two events at well-separated locations are observed to be simultaneous. Simultaneity, or whether different events occur at the same instant, depends on the frame of reference of the observer. Remember that velocity equals distance divided by time, so t = d/v. If velocity appears to be different, then duration of time appears to be different. \n\nThis illustrates the power of clear thinking. We might have guessed incorrectly that, if light is emitted simultaneously, then two observers halfway between the sources would see the flashes simultaneously. But careful analysis shows this not to be the case. Einstein was brilliant at this type of thought experiment (in German, Gedankenexperiment). He very carefully considered how an observation is made and disregarded what might seem obvious. The validity of thought experiments, of course, is determined by actual observation. The genius of Einstein is evidenced by the fact that experiments have repeatedly confirmed his theory of relativity. No experiments after that of Michelson and Morley were able to detect any ether medium. We will describe later how experiments also confirmed other predictions of special relativity, such as the distance between two objects and the time interval of two events being different for two observers moving with respect to each other. \n\nIn summary: Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures them as occurring at the same time (such as by receiving light from the events). Two events are not necessarily simultaneous to all observers.\n\nThe discrepancies between Newtonian mechanics and relativity theory illustrate an important point about how science advances. Einstein\u2019s theory did not replace Newton\u2019s but rather extended it. It is not unusual that a new theory must be developed to account for new information. In most cases, the new theory is built on the foundation of older theory. It is rare that old theories are completely replaced.\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about the theory of special relativity, but, as mentioned in the introduction, Einstein developed two relativity theories: special and general. Table 10.1 summarizes the differences between the two theories.",

                {
                    "context": "Consideration of the measurement of elapsed time and simultaneity leads to an important relativistic effect. Time dilation is the phenomenon of time passing more slowly for an observer who is moving relative to another observer.\n\nFor example, suppose an astronaut measures the time it takes for light to travel from the light source, cross her ship, bounce off a mirror, and return. (See Figure 10.5.) How does the elapsed time the astronaut measures compare with the elapsed time measured for the same event by a person on the earth? Asking this question (another thought experiment) produces a profound result. We find that the elapsed time for a process depends on who is measuring it. In this case, the time measured by the astronaut is smaller than the time measured by the earth bound observer. The passage of time is different for the two observers because the distance the light travels in the astronaut\u2019s frame is smaller than in the earth bound frame. Light travels at the same speed in each frame, and so it will take longer to travel the greater distance in the earth bound frame.\n\nThe relationship between \u0394t and \u0394to is given by\n\n$$\\[\\Delta t = \\gamma\\Delta t_{0},\\]$$\n\nwhere $$\\(\\gamma\\)$$ is the relativistic factor given by\n\n$$\\[\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}},\\]$$\n\nand v and c are the speeds of the moving observer and light, respectively.\n\nNotice that when the velocity v is small compared to the speed of light c, then v/c becomes small, and $$\\(\\gamma\\)$$ becomes close to 1. When this happens, time measurements are the same in both frames of reference. Relativistic effects, meaning those that have to do with special relativity, usually become significant when speeds become comparable to the speed of light. This is seen to be the case for time dilation.\n\nYou may have seen science fiction movies in which space travelers return to Earth after a long trip to find that the planet and everyone on it has aged much more than they have. This type of scenario is a based on a thought experiment, known as the twin paradox, which imagines a pair of twins, one of whom goes on a trip into space while the other stays home. When the space traveler returns, she finds her twin has aged much more than she. This happens because the traveling twin has been in two frames of reference, one leaving Earth and one returning.\n\nTime dilation has been confirmed by comparing the time recorded by an atomic clock sent into orbit to the time recorded by a clock that remained on Earth. GPS satellites must also be adjusted to compensate for time dilation in order to give accurate positioning.\n\nHave you ever driven on a road, like that shown in Figure 10.6, that seems like it goes on forever? If you look ahead, you might say you have about 10 km left to go. Another traveler might say the road ahead looks like it is about 15 km long. If you both measured the road, however, you would agree. Traveling at everyday speeds, the distance you both measure would be the same. You will read in this section, however, that this is not true at relativistic speeds. Close to the speed of light, distances measured are not the same when measured by different observers moving with respect to one other.\n\nOne thing all observers agree upon is their relative speed. When one observer is traveling away from another, they both see the other receding at the same speed, regardless of whose frame of reference is chosen. Remember that speed equals distance divided by time: v = d/t. If the observers experience a difference in elapsed time, they must also observe a difference in distance traversed. This is because the ratio d/t must be the same for both observers.\n\nThe shortening of distance experienced by an observer moving with respect to the points whose distance apart is measured is called length contraction. Proper length, L0, is the distance between two points measured in the reference frame where the observer and the points are at rest. The observer in motion with respect to the points measures L. These two lengths are related by the equation\n\n$$\\[L = \\frac{L_{0}}{\\gamma}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nBecause $$\\(\\text{\u03b3}\\)$$ is the same expression used in the time dilation equation above, the equation becomes\n\n$$\\[L = L_{0}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}.\\]$$\n\nTo see how length contraction is seen by a moving observer, go to this simulation. Here you can also see that simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction are interrelated phenomena.\n\nThis link is to a simulation that illustrates the relativity of simultaneous events.\n\nIn classical physics, momentum is a simple product of mass and velocity. When special relativity is taken into account, objects that have mass have a speed limit. What effect do you think mass and velocity have on the momentum of objects moving at relativistic speeds; i.e., speeds close to the speed of light?\n\nMomentum is one of the most important concepts in physics. The broadest form of Newton\u2019s second law is stated in terms of momentum. Momentum is conserved in classical mechanics whenever the net external force on a system is zero. This makes momentum conservation a fundamental tool for analyzing collisions. We will see that momentum has the same importance in modern physics. Relativistic momentum is conserved, and much of what we know about subatomic structure comes from the analysis of collisions of accelerator-produced relativistic particles.\n\nOne of the postulates of special relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Does the law of conservation of momentum survive this requirement at high velocities? The answer is yes, provided that the momentum is defined as follows.\n\nRelativistic momentum, p, is classical momentum multiplied by the relativistic factor $$\\(\\gamma\\text{.}\\)$$ \n\n$$\\[\\mathbf{p} = \\gamma m\\mathbf{u},\\]$$\n\nwhere $$\\(m\\)$$ is the rest mass of the object (that is, the mass measured at rest, without any $$\\(\\gamma\\)$$ factor involved), $$\\(\\mathbf{u}\\)$$ is its velocity relative to an observer, and $$\\[\\gamma,\\]$$ as before, is the relativistic factor. We use the mass of the object as measured at rest because we cannot determine its mass while it is moving.\n\nNote that we use $$\\(\\mathbf{u}\\)$$ for velocity here to distinguish it from relative velocity $$\\(\\mathbf{v}\\)$$ between observers. Only one observer is being considered here. With $$\\(\\mathbf{p}\\)$$ defined in this way, $$\\(\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{tot}}\\)$$ is conserved whenever the net external force is zero, just as in classical physics. Again we see that the relativistic quantity becomes virtually the same as the classical at low velocities. That is, relativistic momentum $$\\(\\gamma m\\mathbf{u}\\)$$ becomes the classical $$\\(m\\mathbf{u}\\)$$ at low velocities, because $$\\(\\gamma\\)$$ is very nearly equal to 1 at low velocities.\n\nRelativistic momentum has the same intuitive feel as classical momentum. It is greatest for large masses moving at high velocities. Because of the factor $$\\(\\gamma,\\)$$ however, relativistic momentum behaves differently from classical momentum by approaching infinity as $$\\(\\mathbf{u}\\)$$ approaches $$\\(c\\text{.}\\)$$  (See Figure 10.7.) This is another indication that an object with mass cannot reach the speed of light. If it did, its momentum would become infinite, which is an unreasonable value.\n\nRelativistic momentum is defined in such a way that the conservation of momentum will hold in all inertial frames. Whenever the net external force on a system is zero, relativistic momentum is conserved, just as is the case for classical momentum. This has been verified in numerous experiments.",

                    "context": "The original source of all the energy we use is the conversion of mass into energy. Most of this energy is generated by nuclear reactions in the sun and radiated to Earth in the form of electromagnetic radiation, where it is then transformed into all the forms with which we are familiar. The remaining energy from nuclear reactions is produced in nuclear power plants and in Earth\u2019s interior. In each of these cases, the source of the energy is the conversion of a small amount of mass into a large amount of energy. These sources are shown in Figure 10.8.\n\nThe first postulate of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Einstein showed that the law of conservation of energy is valid relativistically, if we define energy to include a relativistic factor. The result of his analysis is that a particle or object of mass m moving at velocity u has relativistic energy given by\n\n$$\\[E = \\gamma mc^{2}.\\]$$\n\nThis is the expression for the total energy of an object of mass m at any speed u and includes both kinetic and potential energy. Look back at the equation for $$\\(\\gamma\\)$$ and you will see that it is equal to 1 when u is 0; that is, when an object is at rest. Then the rest energy, E0, is simply\n\n$$\\[E_{0} = mc^{2}.\\]$$\n\nThis is the correct form of Einstein\u2019s famous equation.\n\nThis equation is very useful to nuclear physicists because it can be used to calculate the energy released by a nuclear reaction. This is done simply by subtracting the mass of the products of such a reaction from the mass of the reactants. The difference is the m in $$\\(E_{0} = mc^{2}\\text{.}\\)$$  Here is a simple example:\n\nA positron is a type of antimatter that is just like an electron, except that it has a positive charge. When a positron and an electron collide, their masses are completely annihilated and converted to energy in the form of gamma rays. Because both particles have a rest mass of 9.11 \u00d7 10\u201331 kg, we multiply the mc2 term by 2. So the energy of the gamma rays is\n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{ccl}\nE_{0} & = & {2(9.11 \\times 10^{- 31}\\text{~kg})\\left( 3.00 \\times 10^{8}\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}} \\right)^{2}} \\\\\n & = & {1.64 \\times 10^{- 13}\\frac{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{2}}{\\text{s}^{2}}} \\\\\n & = & {1.64 \\times 10^{- 13}\\text{J}} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nwhere we have the expression for the joule (J) in terms of its SI base units of kg, m, and s. In general, the nuclei of stable isotopes have less mass then their constituent subatomic particles. The energy equivalent of this difference is called the binding energy of the nucleus. This energy is released during the formation of the isotope from its constituent particles because the product is more stable than the reactants. Expressed as mass, it is called the mass defect. For example, a helium nucleus is made of two neutrons and two protons and has a mass of 4.0003 atomic mass units (u). The sum of the masses of two protons and two neutrons is 4.0330 u. The mass defect then is 0.0327 u. Converted to kg, the mass defect is 5.0442 \u00d7 10\u201330 kg. Multiplying this mass times c2 gives a binding energy of 4.540 \u00d7 10\u201312 J. This does not sound like much because it is only one atom. If you were to make one gram of helium out of neutrons and protons, it would release 683,000,000,000 J. By comparison, burning one gram of coal releases about 24 J.",

                    "context": "What is temperature? It\u2019s one of those concepts so ingrained in our everyday lives that, although we know what it means intuitively, it can be hard to define. It is tempting to say that temperature measures heat, but this is not strictly true. Heat is the transfer of energy due to a temperature difference. Temperature is defined in terms of the instrument we use to tell us how hot or cold an object is, based on a mechanism and scale invented by people. Temperature is literally defined as what we measure on a thermometer.\n\nHeat is often confused with temperature. For example, we may say that the heat was unbearable, when we actually mean that the temperature was high. This is because we are sensitive to the flow of energy by heat, rather than the temperature. Since heat, like work, transfers energy, it has the SI unit of joule (J).\n\nAtoms and molecules are constantly in motion, bouncing off one another in random directions. Recall that kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and that it increases in proportion to velocity squared. Without going into mathematical detail, we can say that thermal energy\u2014the energy associated with heat\u2014is the average kinetic energy of the particles (molecules or atoms) in a substance. Faster moving molecules have greater kinetic energies, and so the substance has greater thermal energy, and thus a higher temperature. The total internal energy of a system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of its atoms and molecules. Thermal energy is one of the subcategories of internal energy, as is chemical energy.\n\nTo measure temperature, some scale must be used as a standard of measurement. The three most commonly used temperature scales are the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scales. Both the Fahrenheit scale and Celsius scale are relative temperature scales, meaning that they are made around a reference point. For example, the Celsius scale uses the freezing point of water as its reference point; all measurements are either lower than the freezing point of water by a given number of degrees (and have a negative sign), or higher than the freezing point of water by a given number of degrees (and have a positive sign). The boiling point of water is 100 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$  for the Celsius scale, and its unit is the degree Celsius  (\u00b0C(\u00b0C(\u00b0C ).\n\nOn the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is at 32 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0F}\\)$$, and the boiling point is at 212 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0F}\\)$$ . The unit of temperature on this scale is the degree Fahrenheit  (\u00b0F(\u00b0F(\u00b0F ). Note that the difference in degrees between the freezing and boiling points is greater for the Fahrenheit scale than for the Celsius scale. Therefore, a temperature difference of one degree Celsius is greater than a temperature difference of one degree Fahrenheit. Since 100 Celsius degrees span the same range as 180 Fahrenheit degrees, one degree on the Celsius scale is 1.8 times larger than one degree on the Fahrenheit scale (because  $$\\(\\frac{180}{100} = \\frac{9}{5} = 1.8\\)$$ ). This relationship can be used to convert between temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius (see Figure 11.2).\n\nThe Kelvin scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science because it is an absolute temperature scale. This means that the theoretically lowest-possible temperature is assigned the value of zero. Zero degrees on the Kelvin scale is known as absolute zero; it is theoretically the point at which there is no molecular motion to produce thermal energy. On the original Kelvin scale first created by Lord Kelvin, all temperatures have positive values, making it useful for scientific work. The official temperature unit on this scale is the kelvin, which is abbreviated as K. The freezing point of water is 273.15 K, and the boiling point of water is 373.15 K.\n\nAlthough absolute zero is possible in theory, it cannot be reached in practice. The lowest temperature ever created and measured during a laboratory experiment was  $$\\(1.0 \\times 10^{- 10}\\)$$  K, at Helsinki University of Technology in Finland. In comparison, the coldest recorded temperature for a place on Earth\u2019s surface was 183 K (\u201389 \t\u00b0C), at Vostok, Antarctica, and the coldest known place (outside the lab) in the universe is the Boomerang Nebula, with a temperature of 1 K. Luckily, most of us humans will never have to experience such extremes.\n\nThe average normal body temperature is 98.6 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0F}\\)$$  (37.0 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$ ), but people have been known to survive with body temperatures ranging from 75 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0F}\\)$$  to 111 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0F}\\)$$  (24 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$  to 44 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$ ).",

                    "context": "We learned in the previous section that temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in a substance, and that the average internal kinetic energy of a substance is higher when the substance\u2019s temperature is higher.\n\nIf two objects at different temperatures are brought in contact with each other, energy is transferred from the hotter object (that is, the object with the greater temperature) to the colder (lower temperature) object, until both objects are at the same temperature. There is no net heat transfer once the temperatures are equal because the amount of heat transferred from one object to the other is the same as the amount of heat returned. One of the major effects of heat transfer is temperature change: Heating increases the temperature while cooling decreases it. Experiments show that the heat transferred to or from a substance depends on three factors\u2014the change in the substance\u2019s temperature, the mass of the substance, and certain physical properties related to the phase of the substance.\n\nThe equation for heat transfer Q is\n\n$$\\[Q\\  = \\ mc\\Delta T,\\]$$\n\nwhere m is the mass of the substance and \u0394T is the change in its temperature, in units of Celsius or Kelvin. The symbol c stands for specific heat, and depends on the material and phase. The specific heat is the amount of heat necessary to change the temperature of 1.00 kg of mass by 1.00 \u00baC. The specific heat c is a property of the substance; its SI unit is J/(kg $$\\(\\cdot\\)$$ K) or J/(kg $$\\(\\cdot\\)$$ $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$ ). The temperature change ( $$\\(\\Delta T\\)$$ ) is the same in units of kelvins and degrees Celsius (but not degrees Fahrenheit). Specific heat is closely related to the concept of heat capacity. Heat capacity is the amount of heat necessary to change the temperature of a substance by 1.00 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$ . In equation form, heat capacity C is  $$\\(C = mc\\)$$, where m is mass and c is specific heat. Note that heat capacity is the same as specific heat, but without any dependence on mass. Consequently, two objects made up of the same material but with different masses will have different heat capacities. This is because the heat capacity is a property of an object, but specific heat is a property of any object made of the same material.\n\nValues of specific heat must be looked up in tables, because there is no simple way to calculate them. Table 11.2 gives the values of specific heat for a few substances as a handy reference. We see from this table that the specific heat of water is five times that of glass, which means that it takes five times as much heat to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water than to raise the temperature of 1 kg of glass by the same number of degrees.",

                    "context": "Whenever there is a temperature difference, heat transfer occurs. Heat transfer may happen rapidly, such as through a cooking pan, or slowly, such as through the walls of an insulated cooler.\n\nThere are three different heat transfer methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. At times, all three may happen simultaneously. See Figure 11.3.\n\nConduction is heat transfer through direct physical contact. Heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the bottom of a pan is transferred by conduction. Sometimes, we try to control the conduction of heat to make ourselves more comfortable. Since the rate of heat transfer is different for different materials, we choose fabrics, such as a thick wool sweater, that slow down the transfer of heat away from our bodies in winter.\n\nAs you walk barefoot across the living room carpet, your feet feel relatively comfortable\u2026until you step onto the kitchen\u2019s tile floor. Since the carpet and tile floor are both at the same temperature, why does one feel colder than the other? This is explained by different rates of heat transfer: The tile material removes heat from your skin at a greater rate than the carpeting, which makes it feel colder.\n\nSome materials simply conduct thermal energy faster than others. In general, metals (like copper, aluminum, gold, and silver) are good heat conductors, whereas materials like wood, plastic, and rubber are poor heat conductors.\n\nFigure 11.4 shows particles (either atoms or molecules) in two bodies at different temperatures. The (average) kinetic energy of a particle in the hot body is higher than in the colder body. If two particles collide, energy transfers from the particle with greater kinetic energy to the particle with less kinetic energy. When two bodies are in contact, many particle collisions occur, resulting in a net flux of heat from the higher-temperature body to the lower-temperature body. The heat flux depends on the temperature difference  $$\\(\\Delta T = T_{\\text{hot}} - T_{\\text{cold}}\\)$$ . Therefore, you will get a more severe burn from boiling water than from hot tap water.\n\nConvection is heat transfer by the movement of a fluid. This type of heat transfer happens, for example, in a pot boiling on the stove, or in thunderstorms, where hot air rises up to the base of the clouds.\n\nAs the temperature of fluids increase, they expand and become less dense. For example, Figure 11.4 could represent the wall of a balloon with different temperature gases inside the balloon than outside in the environment.  The hotter and thus faster moving gas particles inside the balloon strike the surface with more force than the cooler air outside, causing the balloon to expand. This decrease in density relative to its environment creates buoyancy (the tendency to rise). Convection is driven by buoyancy\u2014hot air rises because it is less dense than the surrounding air. \n\nSometimes, we control the temperature of our homes or ourselves by controlling air movement. Sealing leaks around doors with weather stripping keeps out the cold wind in winter. The house in Figure 11.5 and the pot of water on the stove in Figure 11.6 are both examples of convection and buoyancy by human design. Ocean currents and large-scale atmospheric circulation transfer energy from one part of the globe to another, and are examples of natural convection.\n\nRadiation is a form of heat transfer that occurs when electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. Electromagnetic radiation includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays, all of which have different wavelengths and amounts of energy (shorter wavelengths have higher frequency and more energy).\n\nYou can feel the heat transfer from a fire and from the sun. Similarly, you can sometimes tell that the oven is hot without touching its door or looking inside\u2014it may just warm you as you walk by. Another example is thermal radiation from the human body; people are constantly emitting infrared radiation, which is not visible to the human eye, but is felt as heat.\n\nRadiation is the only method of heat transfer where no medium is required, meaning that the heat doesn\u2019t need to come into direct contact with or be transported by any matter. The space between Earth and the sun is largely empty, without any possibility of heat transfer by convection or conduction. Instead, heat is transferred by radiation, and Earth is warmed as it absorbs electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun.\n\nAll objects absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation (see Figure 11.7). The rate of heat transfer by radiation depends mainly on the color of the object. Black is the most effective absorber and radiator, and white is the least effective. People living in hot climates generally avoid wearing black clothing, for instance. Similarly, black asphalt in a parking lot will be hotter than adjacent patches of grass on a summer day, because black absorbs better than green. The reverse is also true\u2014black radiates better than green. On a clear summer night, the black asphalt will be colder than the green patch of grass, because black radiates energy faster than green. In contrast, white is a poor absorber and also a poor radiator. A white object reflects nearly all radiation, like a mirror. ",

                    "context": "So far, we have learned that adding thermal energy by heat increases the temperature of a substance. But surprisingly, there are situations where adding energy does not change the temperature of a substance at all! Instead, the additional thermal energy acts to loosen bonds between molecules or atoms and causes a phase change. Because this energy enters or leaves a system during a phase change without causing a temperature change in the system, it is known as latent heat (latent means hidden).\n\nThe three phases of matter that you frequently encounter are solid, liquid and gas (see Figure 11.8). Solid has the least energetic state; atoms in solids are in close contact, with forces between them that allow the particles to vibrate but not change position with neighboring particles. (These forces can be thought of as springs that can be stretched or compressed, but not easily broken.)\n\nLiquid has a more energetic state, in which particles can slide smoothly past one another and change neighbors, although they are still held together by their mutual attraction.\n\nGas has a more energetic state than liquid, in which particles are broken free of their bonds. Particles in gases are separated by distances that are large compared with the size of the particles.\n\nThe most energetic state of all is plasma. Although you may not have heard much about plasma, it is actually the most common state of matter in the universe\u2014stars are made up of plasma, as is lightning. The plasma state is reached by heating a gas to the point where particles are pulled apart, separating the electrons from the rest of the particle. This produces an ionized gas that is a combination of the negatively charged free electrons and positively charged ions, known as plasma.\n\nDuring a phase change, matter changes from one phase to another, either through the addition of energy by heat and the transition to a more energetic state, or from the removal of energy by heat and the transition to a less energetic state.\n\nPhase changes to a more energetic state include the following:\n\nMelting\u2014Solid to liquid Vaporization\u2014Liquid to gas (included boiling and evaporation) Sublimation\u2014Solid to gas \n\nPhase changes to a less energetic state are as follows:\n\nCondensation\u2014Gas to liquid Freezing\u2014Liquid to solid \n\nEnergy is required to melt a solid because the bonds between the particles in the solid must be broken. Since the energy involved in a phase changes is used to break bonds, there is no increase in the kinetic energies of the particles, and therefore no rise in temperature. Similarly, energy is needed to vaporize a liquid to overcome the attractive forces between particles in the liquid. There is no temperature change until a phase change is completed. The temperature of a cup of soda and ice that is initially at 0 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$  stays at 0 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$  until all of the ice has melted. In the reverse of these processes\u2014freezing and condensation\u2014energy is released from the latent heat (see Figure 11.9).\n\nThe heat, Q, required to change the phase of a sample of mass m is\n\n $$\\(Q = mL_{f}\\)$$  (for melting/freezing),\n\n $$\\(Q = mL_{v}\\)$$  (for vaporization/condensation),\n\nwhere  $$\\(L_{f}\\)$$  is the latent heat of fusion, and  $$\\(L_{v}\\)$$  is the latent heat of vaporization. The latent heat of fusion is the amount of heat needed to cause a phase change between solid and liquid. The latent heat of vaporization is the amount of heat needed to cause a phase change between liquid and gas.  $$\\(L_{f}\\)$$  and  $$\\(L_{v}\\)$$  are coefficients that vary from substance to substance, depending on the strength of intermolecular forces, and both have standard units of J/kg. See Table 11.3 for values of  $$\\(L_{f}\\)$$  and  $$\\(L_{v}\\)$$  of different substances.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the example of adding heat to ice to examine its transitions through all three phases\u2014solid to liquid to gas. A phase diagram indicating the temperature changes of water as energy is added is shown in Figure 11.10. The ice starts out at \u221220 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$, and its temperature rises linearly, absorbing heat at a constant rate until it reaches 0 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0}\\text{.}\\)$$  Once at this temperature, the ice gradually melts, absorbing 334 kJ/kg. The temperature remains constant at 0 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$  during this phase change. Once all the ice has melted, the temperature of the liquid water rises, absorbing heat at a new constant rate. At 100 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$, the water begins to boil and the temperature again remains constant while the water absorbs 2256 kJ/kg during this phase change. When all the liquid has become steam, the temperature rises again at a constant rate.\n\nWe have seen that vaporization requires heat transfer to a substance from its surroundings. Condensation is the reverse process, where heat in transferred away from a substance to its surroundings. This release of latent heat increases the temperature of the surroundings. Energy must be removed from the condensing particles to make a vapor condense. This is why condensation occurs on cold surfaces: the heat transfers energy away from the warm vapor to the cold surface. The energy is exactly the same as that required to cause the phase change in the other direction, from liquid to vapor, and so it can be calculated from  $$\\(Q = mL_{v}\\)$$ . Latent heat is also released into the environment when a liquid freezes, and can be calculated from  $$\\(Q = mL_{f}\\)$$ .",

The objects are then in thermal equilibrium, and no further temperature changes will occur if they are isolated from other systems. The systems interact and change because their temperatures are different, and the changes stop once their temperatures are the same. Thermal equilibrium is established when two bodies are in thermal contact with each other\u2014meaning heat transfer (i.e., the transfer of energy by heat) can occur between them. If two systems cannot freely exchange energy, they will not reach thermal equilibrium. (It is fortunate that empty space stands between Earth and the sun, because a state of thermal equilibrium with the sun would be too toasty for life on this planet!)\n\nIf two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each another, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C. This statement may seem obvious, because all three have the same temperature, but it is basic to thermodynamics. It is called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.\n\nYou may be wondering at this point, why the wacky name? Shouldn\u2019t this be called the first law of thermodynamics rather than the zeroth? The explanation is that this law was discovered after the first and second laws of thermodynamics but is so fundamental that scientists decided it should logically come first.\n\nAs an example of the zeroth law in action, consider newborn babies in neonatal intensive-care units in hospitals. Prematurely born or sick newborns are placed in special incubators. These babies have very little covering while in the incubators, so to an observer, they look as though they may not be warm enough. However, inside the incubator, the temperature of the air, the cot, and the baby are all the same\u2014that is, they are in thermal equilibrium. The ambient temperature is just high enough to keep the baby safe and comfortable.",

                    "context": "Before covering the first law of thermodynamics, it is first important to understand the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature. Pressure, P, is defined as\n\n$$\\[P = \\frac{F}{A},\\]$$\n\nwhere F is a force applied to an area, A, that is perpendicular to the force.\n\nDepending on the area over which it is exerted, a given force can have a significantly different effect, as shown in Figure 12.3.\n\nThe SI unit for pressure is the pascal, where  $$\\(\\text{1~Pa} = \\text{1~N/m}^{\\text{2}}.\\)$$\n\nPressure is defined for all states of matter but is particularly important when discussing fluids (such as air). You have probably heard the word pressure being used in relation to blood (high or low blood pressure) and in relation to the weather (high- and low-pressure weather systems). These are only two of many examples of pressures in fluids.\n\nThe relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature for an ideal gas is given by the ideal gas law. A gas is considered ideal at low pressure and fairly high temperature, and forces between its component particles can be ignored. The ideal gas law states that\n\n$$\\[PV = NkT.\\]$$\n\nwhere P is the pressure of a gas, V is the volume it occupies, N is the number of particles (atoms or molecules) in the gas, and T is its absolute temperature. The constant k is called the Boltzmann constant and has the value  $$\\(k = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}\\text{J/K}\\text{,}\\)$$  For the purposes of this chapter, we will not go into calculations using the ideal gas law. Instead, it is important for us to notice from the equation that the following are true for a given mass of gas:\n\nWhen volume is constant, pressure is directly proportional to temperature. When temperature is constant, pressure is inversely proportional to volume. When pressure is constant, volume is directly proportional to temperature. \n\nThis last point describes thermal expansion\u2014the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature. What is the underlying cause of thermal expansion? An increase in temperature means that there\u2019s an increase in the kinetic energy of the individual atoms. Gases are especially affected by thermal expansion, although liquids expand to a lesser extent with similar increases in temperature, and even solids have minor expansions at higher temperatures. This is why railroad tracks and bridges have expansion joints that allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes.\n\nTo get some idea of how pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas are related to one another, consider what happens when you pump air into a deflated tire. The tire\u2019s volume first increases in direct proportion to the amount of air injected, without much increase in the tire pressure. Once the tire has expanded to nearly its full size, the walls limit volume expansion. If you continue to pump air into tire (which now has a nearly constant volume), the pressure increases with increasing temperature (see Figure 12.4).",

Thermal expansion is the increase, or decrease, of the size (length, area, or volume) of a body due to a change in temperature. The ideal gas law relates the pressure and volume of a gas to the number of gas particles (atoms or molecules) and the absolute temperature of the gas. Heat and work are the two distinct methods of energy transfer. Heat is energy transferred solely due to a temperature difference. The first law of thermodynamics is given as  $$\\(\\Delta U = Q - W\\)$$, where  $$\\(\\Delta U\\)$$  is the change in internal energy of a system, Q is the net energy transfer into the system by heat (the sum of all transfers by heat into and out of the system), and W is the net work done by the system (the sum of all energy transfers by work out of or into the system). Both Q and W represent energy in transit; only  $$\\(\\Delta U\\)$$  represents an independent quantity of energy capable of being stored. The internal energy U of a system depends only on the state of the system, and not how it reached that state. ",

                    "context": "Heat (Q) and work (W) are the two ways to add or remove energy from a system. The processes are very different. Heat is driven by temperature differences, while work involves a force exerted through a distance. Nevertheless, heat and work can produce identical results. For example, both can cause a temperature increase. Heat transfers energy into a system, such as when the sun warms the air in a bicycle tire and increases the air\u2019s temperature. Similarly, work can be done on the system, as when the bicyclist pumps air into the tire. Once the temperature increase has occurred, it is impossible to tell whether it was caused by heat or work. Heat and work are both energy in transit\u2014neither is stored as such in a system. However, both can change the internal energy, U, of a system.\n\nInternal energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of a system\u2019s atoms and molecules. It can be divided into many subcategories, such as thermal and chemical energy, and depends only on the state of a system (that is, P, V, and T), not on how the energy enters or leaves the system.\n\nIn order to understand the relationship between heat, work, and internal energy, we use the first law of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics applies the conservation of energy principle to systems where heat and work are the methods of transferring energy into and out of the systems. It can also be used to describe how energy transferred by heat is converted and transferred again by work.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a closed system equals the net heat transfer into the system minus the net work done by the system. In equation form, the first law of thermodynamics is\n\n$$\\[\\Delta U = Q - W.\\]$$\n\nHere,  $$\\(\\Delta U\\)$$ is the change in internal energy, U, of the system. As shown in Figure 12.6, Q is the net heat transferred into the system\u2014that is, Q is the sum of all heat transfers into and out of the system. W is the net work done by the system\u2014that is, W is the sum of all work done on or by the system. By convention, if Q is positive, then there is a net heat transfer into the system; if W is positive, then there is net work done by the system. So positive Q adds energy to the system by heat, and positive W takes energy from the system by work. Note that if heat transfers more energy into the system than that which is done by work, the difference is stored as internal energy.\n\nIt follows also that negative Q indicates that energy is transferred away from the system by heat and so decreases the system\u2019s internal energy, whereas negative W is work done on the system, which increases the internal energy.",

This phenomenon is explained by the second law of thermodynamics, which relies on a concept known as entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. Entropy also describes how much energy is not available to do work. The more disordered a system and higher the entropy, the less of a system's energy is available to do work.\n\nAlthough all forms of energy can be used to do work, it is not possible to use the entire available energy for work. Consequently, not all energy transferred by heat can be converted into work, and some of it is lost in the form of waste heat\u2014that is, heat that does not go toward doing work. The unavailability of energy is important in thermodynamics; in fact, the field originated from efforts to convert heat to work, as is done by engines.\n\nThe equation for the change in entropy,  $$\\(\\Delta S\\)$$, is\n\n$$\\[\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T},\\ \\]$$\n\nwhere Q is the heat that transfers energy during a process, and T is the absolute temperature at which the process takes place.\n\nQ is positive for energy transferred into the system by heat and negative for energy transferred out of the system by heat. In SI, entropy is expressed in units of joules per kelvin (J/K). If temperature changes during the process, then it is usually a good approximation (for small changes in temperature) to take T to be the average temperature in order to avoid trickier math (calculus).",

                    "context": "Have you ever played the card game 52 pickup? If so, you have been on the receiving end of a practical joke and, in the process, learned a valuable lesson about the nature of the universe as described by the second law of thermodynamics. In the game of 52 pickup, the prankster tosses an entire deck of playing cards onto the floor, and you get to pick them up. In the process of picking up the cards, you may have noticed that the amount of work required to restore the cards to an orderly state in the deck is much greater than the amount of work required to toss the cards and create the disorder.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any spontaneous process; it never decreases. An important implication of this law is that heat transfers energy spontaneously from higher- to lower-temperature objects, but never spontaneously in the reverse direction. This is because entropy increases for heat transfer of energy from hot to cold (Figure 12.9). Because the change in entropy is Q/T, there is a larger change in  $$\\(\\Delta S\\)$$  at lower temperatures (smaller T). The decrease in entropy of the hot (larger T) object is therefore less than the increase in entropy of the cold (smaller T) object, producing an overall increase in entropy for the system.\n\nAnother way of thinking about this is that it is impossible for any process to have, as its sole result, heat transferring energy from a cooler to a hotter object. Heat cannot transfer energy spontaneously from colder to hotter, because the entropy of the overall system would decrease.\n\nSuppose we mix equal masses of water that are originally at two different temperatures, say  $$\\(\\text{20}\\text{.0~\u00b0C}\\)$$  and  $$\\(\\text{40}\\text{.0~\u00b0C}\\)$$ . The result will be water at an intermediate temperature of  $$\\(\\text{30}\\text{.0~\u00b0C}\\)$$ . Three outcomes have resulted: entropy has increased, some energy has become unavailable to do work, and the system has become less orderly. Let us think about each of these results.\n\nFirst, why has entropy increased? Mixing the two bodies of water has the same effect as the heat transfer of energy from the higher-temperature substance to the lower-temperature substance. The mixing decreases the entropy of the hotter water but increases the entropy of the colder water by a greater amount, producing an overall increase in entropy.\n\nSecond, once the two masses of water are mixed, there is no more temperature difference left to drive energy transfer by heat and therefore to do work. The energy is still in the water, but it is now unavailable to do work.\n\nThird, the mixture is less orderly, or to use another term, less structured. Rather than having two masses at different temperatures and with different distributions of molecular speeds, we now have a single mass with a broad distribution of molecular speeds, the average of which yields an intermediate temperature.\n\nThese three results\u2014entropy, unavailability of energy, and disorder\u2014not only are related but are, in fact, essentially equivalent. Heat transfer of energy from hot to cold is related to the tendency in nature for systems to become disordered and for less energy to be available for use as work.\n\nBased on this law, what cannot happen? A cold object in contact with a hot one never spontaneously transfers energy by heat to the hot object, getting colder while the hot object gets hotter. Nor does a hot, stationary automobile ever spontaneously cool off and start moving. \n\nAnother example is the expansion of a puff of gas introduced into one corner of a vacuum chamber. The gas expands to fill the chamber, but it never regroups on its own in the corner. The random motion of the gas molecules could take them all back to the corner, but this is never observed to happen (Figure 12.10).\n\nWe've explained that heat never transfers energy spontaneously from a colder to a hotter object. The key word here is spontaneously. If we do work on a system, it is possible to transfer energy by heat from a colder to hotter object. We'll learn more about this in the next section, covering refrigerators as one of the applications of the laws of thermodynamics.\n\nSometimes people misunderstand the second law of thermodynamics, thinking that based on this law, it is impossible for entropy to decrease at any particular location. But, it actually is possible for the entropy of one part of the universe to decrease, as long as the total change in entropy of the universe increases. In equation form, we can write this as\n\n $$\\[\\Delta S_{\\text{tot}} = \\Delta S_{\\text{syst}} + \\Delta S_{\\text{envir}} > 0\\text{.}\\]$$ \n\nBased on this equation, we see that  $$\\(\\Delta S_{\\text{syst}}\\)$$  can be negative as long as  $$\\(\\Delta S_{\\text{envir}}\\)$$  is positive and greater in magnitude.\n\nHow is it possible for the entropy of a system to decrease? Energy transfer is necessary. If you pick up marbles that are scattered about the room and put them into a cup, your work has decreased the entropy of that system. If you gather iron ore from the ground and convert it into steel and build a bridge, your work has decreased the entropy of that system. Energy coming from the sun can decrease the entropy of local systems on Earth\u2014that is,  $$\\(\\Delta S_{\\text{syst}}\\)$$  is negative. But the overall entropy of the rest of the universe increases by a greater amount\u2014that is,  $$\\(\\Delta S_{\\text{envir}}\\)$$  is positive and greater in magnitude. In the case of the iron ore, although you made the system of the bridge and steel more structured, you did so at the expense of the universe. Altogether, the entropy of the universe is increased by the disorder created by digging up the ore and converting it to steel. Therefore,\n\n$$\\[\\Delta S_{\\text{tot}} = \\Delta S_{\\text{syst}} + \\Delta S_{\\text{envir}} > 0,\\]$$\n\nand the second law of thermodynamics is not violated.\n\nEvery time a plant stores some solar energy in the form of chemical potential energy, or an updraft of warm air lifts a soaring bird, Earth experiences local decreases in entropy as it uses part of the energy transfer from the sun into deep space to do work. There is a large total increase in entropy resulting from this massive energy transfer. A small part of this energy transfer by heat is stored in structured systems on Earth, resulting in much smaller, local decreases in entropy.",

                    "context": "In this section, we\u2019ll explore how heat engines, heat pumps, and refrigerators operate in terms of the laws of thermodynamics.\n\nOne of the most important things we can do with heat is to use it to do work for us. A heat engine does exactly this\u2014it makes use of the properties of thermodynamics to transform heat into work. Gasoline and diesel engines, jet engines, and steam turbines that generate electricity are all examples of heat engines.\n\nFigure 12.13 illustrates one of the ways in which heat transfers energy to do work. Fuel combustion releases chemical energy that heat transfers throughout the gas in a cylinder. This increases the gas temperature, which in turn increases the pressure of the gas and, therefore, the force it exerts on a movable piston. The gas does work on the outside world, as this force moves the piston through some distance. Thus, heat transfer of energy to the gas in the cylinder results in work being done.\n\nTo repeat this process, the piston needs to be returned to its starting point. Heat now transfers energy from the gas to the surroundings, so that the gas\u2019s pressure decreases, and a force is exerted by the surroundings to push the piston back through some distance.\n\nA cyclical process brings a system, such as the gas in a cylinder, back to its original state at the end of every cycle. All heat engines use cyclical processes.\n\nHeat engines do work by using part of the energy transferred by heat from some source. As shown in Figure 12.14, heat transfers energy,  $$\\(Q_{\\text{h}}\\)$$, from the high-temperature object (or hot reservoir), whereas heat transfers unused energy,  $$\\(Q_{\\text{c}}\\)$$, into the low-temperature object (or cold reservoir), and the work done by the engine is W. In physics, a reservoir is defined as an infinitely large mass that can take in or put out an unlimited amount of heat, depending upon the needs of the system. The temperature of the hot reservoir is  $$\\(T_{\\text{h}}\\text{,}\\)$$  and the temperature of the cold reservoir is  $$\\(T_{\\text{c}}\\)$$ .\n\nAs noted, a cyclical process brings the system back to its original condition at the end of every cycle. Such a system\u2019s internal energy, U, is the same at the beginning and end of every cycle\u2014that is,  $$\\(\\Delta U = 0\\)$$ . The first law of thermodynamics states that  $$\\(\\Delta U = Q - W\\text{,}\\)$$  where Q is the net heat transfer during the cycle, and W is the net work done by the system. The net heat transfer is the energy transferred in by heat from the hot reservoir minus the amount that is transferred out to the cold reservoir ( $$\\(Q = Q_{\\text{h}} - Q_{\\text{c}}\\)$$ ). Because there is no change in internal energy for a complete cycle ( $$\\(\\Delta U = 0\\)$$ ), we have\n\n$$\\[0 = Q - W,\\]$$\n\nso that\n\n$$\\[W = Q\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nTherefore, the net work done by the system equals the net heat into the system, or\n\n$$\\[W = Q_{\\text{h}} - Q_{\\text{c}}\\]$$\n\nfor a cyclical process.\n\nBecause the hot reservoir is heated externally, which is an energy-intensive process, it is important that the work be done as efficiently as possible. In fact, we want W to equal  $$\\(Q_{\\text{h}}\\)$$, and for there to be no heat to the environment (that is,  $$\\(Q_{\\text{c}} = 0\\)$$ ). Unfortunately, this is impossible. According to the second law of thermodynamics, heat engines cannot have perfect conversion of heat into work. Recall that entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system, which is also how much energy is unavailable to do work. The second law of thermodynamics requires that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any process. Therefore, there is a minimum amount of  $$\\(Q_{\\text{h}}\\)$$  that cannot be used for work. The amount of heat rejected to the cold reservoir,  $$\\(Q_{\\text{c}}\\text{,}\\)$$  depends upon the efficiency of the heat engine. The smaller the increase in entropy,  $$\\(\\Delta S\\)$$ , the smaller the value of  $$\\(Q_{\\text{c}}\\)$$, and the more heat energy is available to do work.\n\nHeat pumps, air conditioners, and refrigerators utilize heat transfer of energy from low to high temperatures, which is the opposite of what heat engines do. Heat transfers energy  $$\\(Q_{\\text{c}}\\)$$  from a cold reservoir and delivers energy  $$\\(Q_{\\text{h}}\\)$$  into a hot one. This requires work input, W, which produces a transfer of energy by heat. Therefore, the total heat transfer to the hot reservoir is\n\n$$\\[Q_{\\text{h}} = Q_{\\text{c}} + W.\\]$$\n\nThe purpose of a heat pump is to transfer energy by heat to a warm environment, such as a home in the winter. The great advantage of using a heat pump to keep your home warm rather than just burning fuel in a fireplace or furnace is that a heat pump supplies  $$\\(Q_{\\text{h}} = Q_{\\text{c}} + W\\)$$ . Heat  $$\\(Q_{\\text{c}}\\)$$  comes from the outside air, even at a temperature below freezing, to the indoor space. You only pay for W, and you get an additional heat transfer of  $$\\(Q_{\\text{c}}\\)$$  from the outside at no cost. In many cases, at least twice as much energy is transferred to the heated space as is used to run the heat pump. When you burn fuel to keep warm, you pay for all of it. The disadvantage to a heat pump is that the work input (required by the second law of thermodynamics) is sometimes more expensive than simply burning fuel, especially if the work is provided by electrical energy.\n\nThe basic components of a heat pump are shown in Figure 12.15. A working fluid, such as a refrigerant, is used. In the outdoor coils (the evaporator), heat  $$\\(Q_{\\text{c}}\\)$$  enters the working fluid from the cold outdoor air, turning it into a gas.\n\nThe electrically driven compressor (work input W) raises the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils that are inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature inside the room, heat transfers energy to the room, and the gas condenses into a liquid. The liquid then flows back through an expansion (pressure-reducing) valve. The liquid, having been cooled through expansion, returns to the outdoor evaporator coils to resume the cycle.\n\nThe quality of a heat pump is judged by how much energy is transferred by heat into the warm space ( $$\\(Q_{\\text{h}}\\)$$ ) compared with how much input work (W) is required.\n\nAir conditioners and refrigerators are designed to cool substances by transferring energy by heat  $$\\(Q_{\\text{c}}\\)$$  out of a cool environment to a warmer one, where heat  $$\\(Q_{\\text{h}}\\)$$  is given up. In the case of a refrigerator, heat is moved out of the inside of the fridge into the surrounding room. For an air conditioner, heat is transferred outdoors from inside a home. Heat pumps are also often used in a reverse setting to cool rooms in the summer.\n\nAs with heat pumps, work input is required for heat transfer of energy from cold to hot. The quality of air conditioners and refrigerators is judged by how much energy is removed by heat  $$\\(Q_{\\text{c}}\\)$$  from a cold environment, compared with how much work, W, is required. So, what is considered the energy benefit in a heat pump, is considered waste heat in a refrigerator.",

Heat pumps draw energy by heat from cold outside air and use it to heat an interior room. A refrigerator is a type of heat pump; it takes energy from the warm air from the inside compartment and transfers it to warmer exterior air. ",

Waves transfer energy from one place to another, but they do not necessarily transfer any mass. Light, sound, and waves in the ocean are common examples of waves. Sound and water waves are mechanical waves; meaning, they require a medium to travel through. The medium may be a solid, a liquid, or a gas, and the speed of the wave depends on the material properties of the medium through which it is traveling. However, light is not a mechanical wave; it can travel through a vacuum such as the empty parts of outer space.\n\nA familiar wave that you can easily imagine is the water wave. For water waves, the disturbance is in the surface of the water, an example of which is the disturbance created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the water surface repeatedly. For sound waves, the disturbance is caused by a change in air pressure, an example of which is when the oscillating cone inside a speaker creates a disturbance. For earthquakes, there are several types of disturbances, which include the disturbance of Earth\u2019s surface itself and the pressure disturbances under the surface. Even radio waves are most easily understood using an analogy with water waves. Because water waves are common and visible, visualizing water waves may help you in studying other types of waves, especially those that are not visible.\n\nWater waves have characteristics common to all waves, such as amplitude, period, frequency, and energy, which we will discuss in the next section.",

Note that both transverse and longitudinal waves can be periodic. A transverse wave propagates so that the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. An example of a transverse wave is shown in Figure 13.3, where a woman moves a toy spring up and down, generating waves that propagate away from herself in the horizontal direction while disturbing the toy spring in the vertical direction.\n\nIn contrast, in a longitudinal wave, the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation. Figure 13.4 shows an example of a longitudinal wave, where the woman now creates a disturbance in the horizontal direction\u2014which is the same direction as the wave propagation\u2014by stretching and then compressing the toy spring.\n\nWaves may be transverse, longitudinal, or a combination of the two. The waves on the strings of musical instruments are transverse (as shown in Figure 13.5), and so are electromagnetic waves, such as visible light. Sound waves in air and water are longitudinal. Their disturbances are periodic variations in pressure that are transmitted in fluids.\n\nSound in solids can be both longitudinal and transverse. Essentially, water waves are also a combination of transverse and longitudinal components, although the simplified water wave illustrated in Figure 13.2 does not show the longitudinal motion of the bird.\n\nEarthquake waves under Earth\u2019s surface have both longitudinal and transverse components as well. The longitudinal waves in an earthquake are called pressure or P-waves, and the transverse waves are called shear or S-waves. These components have important individual characteristics; for example, they propagate at different speeds. Earthquakes also have surface waves that are similar to surface waves on water.",

                    "context": "The two special cases of superposition that produce the simplest results are pure constructive interference and pure destructive interference.\n\nPure constructive interference occurs when two identical waves arrive at the same point exactly in phase. When waves are exactly in phase, the crests of the two waves are precisely aligned, as are the troughs. Refer to Figure 13.11. Because the disturbances add, the pure constructive interference of two waves with the same amplitude produces a wave that has twice the amplitude of the two individual waves, but has the same wavelength.\n\nFigure 13.12 shows two identical waves that arrive exactly out of phase\u2014that is, precisely aligned crest to trough\u2014producing pure destructive interference. Because the disturbances are in opposite directions for this superposition, the resulting amplitude is zero for pure destructive interference; that is, the waves completely cancel out each other.\n\nWhile pure constructive interference and pure destructive interference can occur, they are not very common because they require precisely aligned identical waves. The superposition of most waves that we see in nature produces a combination of constructive and destructive interferences.\n\nWaves that are not results of pure constructive or destructive interference can vary from place to place and time to time. The sound from a stereo, for example, can be loud in one spot and soft in another. The varying loudness means that the sound waves add partially constructively and partially destructively at different locations. A stereo has at least two speakers that create sound waves, and waves can reflect from walls. All these waves superimpose.\n\nAn example of sounds that vary over time from constructive to destructive is found in the combined whine of jet engines heard by a stationary passenger. The volume of the combined sound can fluctuate up and down as the sound from the two engines varies in time from constructive to destructive.\n\nThe two previous examples considered waves that are similar\u2014both stereo speakers generate sound waves with the same amplitude and wavelength, as do the jet engines. But what happens when two waves that are not similar, that is, having different amplitudes and wavelengths, are superimposed? An example of the superposition of two dissimilar waves is shown in Figure 13.13. Here again, the disturbances add and subtract, but they produce an even more complicated-looking wave. The resultant wave from the combined disturbances of two dissimilar waves looks much different than the idealized sinusoidal shape of a periodic wave.",

                    "context": "Sometimes waves do not seem to move and they appear to just stand in place, vibrating. Such waves are called standing waves and are formed by the superposition of two or more waves moving in opposite directions. The waves move through each other with their disturbances adding as they go by. If the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength, then they alternate between constructive and destructive interference. Standing waves created by the superposition of two identical waves moving in opposite directions are illustrated in Figure 13.14.\n\nAs an example, standing waves can be seen on the surface of a glass of milk in a refrigerator. The vibrations from the refrigerator motor create waves on the milk that oscillate up and down but do not seem to move across the surface. The two waves that produce standing waves may be due to the reflections from the side of the glass.\n\nEarthquakes can create standing waves and cause constructive and destructive interferences. As the earthquake waves travel along the surface of Earth and reflect off denser rocks, constructive interference occurs at certain points. As a result, areas closer to the epicenter are not damaged while areas farther from the epicenter are damaged.\n\nStanding waves are also found on the strings of musical instruments and are due to reflections of waves from the ends of the string. Figure 13.15 and Figure 13.16 show three standing waves that can be created on a string that is fixed at both ends. When the wave reaches the fixed end, it has nowhere else to go but back where it came from, causing the reflection. The nodes are the points where the string does not move; more generally, the nodes are the points where the wave disturbance is zero in a standing wave. The fixed ends of strings must be nodes, too, because the string cannot move there.\n\nThe antinode is the location of maximum amplitude in standing waves. The standing waves on a string have a frequency that is related to the propagation speed  $$\\(v_{w}\\)$$  of the disturbance on the string. The wavelength  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$  is determined by the distance between the points where the string is fixed in place.",

When the wave hits the fixed end, it changes direction, returning to its source. As it is reflected, the wave experiences an inversion, which means that it flips vertically. If a wave hits the fixed end with a crest, it will return as a trough, and vice versa (Henderson 2015). Refer to Figure 13.17.\n\nRather than encountering a fixed end or barrier, waves sometimes pass from one medium into another, for instance, from air into water. Different types of media have different properties, such as density or depth, that affect how a wave travels through them. At the boundary between media, waves experience refraction\u2014they change their path of propagation. As the wave bends, it also changes its speed and wavelength upon entering the new medium. Refer to Figure 13.18.\n\nFor example, water waves traveling from the deep end to the shallow end of a swimming pool experience refraction. They bend in a path closer to perpendicular to the surface of the water, propagate slower, and decrease in wavelength as they enter shallower water.",

A disturbance is anything that is moved from its state of equilibrium. Some sound waves can be characterized as periodic waves, which means that the atoms that make up the matter experience simple harmonic motion.\n\nA vibrating string produces a sound wave as illustrated in Figure 14.2, Figure 14.3, and Figure 14.4. As the string oscillates back and forth, part of the string\u2019s energy goes into compressing and expanding the surrounding air. This creates slightly higher and lower pressures. The higher pressure... regions are compressions, and the low pressure regions are rarefactions. The pressure disturbance moves through the air as longitudinal waves with the same frequency as the string. Some of the energy is lost in the form of thermal energy transferred to the air. You may recall from the chapter on waves that areas of compression and rarefaction in longitudinal waves (such as sound) are analogous to crests and troughs in transverse waves.\n\nThe amplitude of a sound wave decreases with distance from its source, because the energy of the wave is spread over a larger and larger area. But some of the energy is also absorbed by objects, such as the eardrum in Figure 14.5, and some of the energy is converted to thermal energy in the air. Figure 14.4 shows a graph of gauge pressure versus distance from the vibrating string. From this figure, you can see that the compression of a longitudinal wave is analogous to the peak of a transverse wave, and the rarefaction of a longitudinal wave is analogous to the trough of a transverse wave. Just as a transverse wave alternates between peaks and troughs, a longitudinal wave alternates between compression and rarefaction.",

Sound travels much slower than light\u2014you can observe this while watching a fireworks display (see Figure 14.6), since the flash of an explosion is seen before its sound is heard.\n\nThe relationship between the speed of sound, its frequency, and wavelength is the same as for all waves:\n\n$$\\[v = f\\lambda,\\]$$\n\nwhere v is the speed of sound (in units of m/s), f is its frequency (in units of hertz), and  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$  is its wavelength (in units of meters). Recall that wavelength is defined as the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave. The wavelength of a sound, therefore, is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a sound wave. Just as the distance between adjacent crests in a transverse wave is one wavelength, the distance between adjacent compressions in a sound wave is also one wavelength, as shown in Figure 14.7. The frequency of a sound wave is the same as that of the source. For example, a tuning fork vibrating at a given frequency would produce sound waves that oscillate at that same frequency. The frequency of a sound is the number of waves that pass a point per unit time.\n\nOne of the more important properties of sound is that its speed is nearly independent of frequency. If this were not the case, and high-frequency sounds traveled faster, for example, then the farther you were from a band in a football stadium, the more the sound from the low-pitch instruments would lag behind the high-pitch ones. But the music from all instruments arrives in cadence independent of distance, and so all frequencies must travel at nearly the same speed.\n\nRecall that  $$\\(v = f\\lambda\\)$$, and in a given medium under fixed temperature and humidity, v is constant. Therefore, the relationship between f and  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$  is inverse: The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength of a sound wave. \n\nThe speed of sound can change when sound travels from one medium to another. However, the frequency usually remains the same because it is like a driven oscillation and maintains the frequency of the original source. If v changes and f remains the same, then the wavelength  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$  must change. Since  $$\\(v = f\\lambda\\)$$, the higher the speed of a sound, the greater its wavelength for a given frequency.",

But in a traffic jam filled with honking cars, you may have to shout just so the person next to you can hear Figure 14.9.The loudness of a sound is related to how energetically its source is vibrating. In cartoons showing a screaming person, the cartoonist often shows an open mouth with a vibrating uvula (the hanging tissue at the back of the mouth) to represent a loud sound coming from the throat. Figure 14.10 shows such a cartoon depiction of a bird loudly expressing its opinion.\n\nA useful quantity for describing the loudness of sounds is called sound intensity. In general, the intensity of a wave is the power per unit area carried by the wave. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred by the wave. In equation form, intensity I is\n\n$$\\[I = \\frac{P}{A}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere P is the power through an area A. The SI unit for I is W/m2. The intensity of a sound depends upon its pressure amplitude. The relationship between the intensity of a sound wave and its pressure amplitude (or pressure variation \u0394p) is\n\n$$\\[I = \\frac{\\left( {\\Delta p} \\right)^{2}}{2\\rho v_{w}}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the density of the material in which the sound wave travels, in units of kg/m3, and v is the speed of sound in the medium, in units of m/s. Pressure amplitude has units of pascals (Pa) or N/m2. Note that \u0394p is half the difference between the maximum and minimum pressure in the sound wave.\n\nWe can see from the equation that the intensity of a sound is proportional to its amplitude squared. The pressure variation is proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation, and so I varies as (\u0394p)2. This relationship is consistent with the fact that the sound wave is produced by some vibration; the greater its pressure amplitude, the more the air is compressed during the vibration. Because the power of a sound wave is the rate at which energy is transferred, the energy of a sound wave is also proportional to its amplitude squared.",

While sound intensity (in W/m2) is the SI unit, the sound intensity level in decibels (dB) is more relevant for how humans perceive sounds. The way our ears perceive sound can be more accurately described by the logarithm of the intensity of a sound rather than the intensity of a sound directly. The sound intensity level \u03b2 is defined to be\n\n$$\\[\\beta\\text{~(dB)} = 10\\text{~log}_{10}\\left( \\frac{I}{I_{0}} \\right)\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere I is sound intensity in watts per meter squared, and I0 = 10\u201312 W/m2 is a reference intensity. I0 is chosen as the reference point because it is the lowest intensity of sound a person with normal hearing can perceive. The decibel level of a sound having an intensity of 10\u201312 W/m2 is \u03b2 = 0 dB, because log10 1 = 0. That is, the threshold of human hearing is 0 decibels.\n\nEach factor of 10 in intensity corresponds to 10 dB. For example, a 90 dB sound compared with a 60 dB sound is 30 dB greater, or three factors of 10 (that is, 103 times) as intense. Another example is that if one sound is 107 as intense as another, it is 70 dB higher.\n\nSince \u03b2 is defined in terms of a ratio, it is unit-less. The unit called decibel (dB) is used to indicate that this ratio is multiplied by 10.

                    "context": "People create sounds by pushing air up through their lungs and through elastic folds in the throat called vocal cords. These folds open and close rhythmically, creating a pressure buildup. As air travels up and past the vocal cords, it causes them to vibrate. This vibration escapes the mouth along with puffs of air as sound. A voice changes in pitch when the muscles of the larynx relax or tighten, changing the tension on the vocal chords. A voice becomes louder when air flow from the lungs increases, making the amplitude of the sound pressure wave greater.\n\nHearing is the perception of sound. It can give us plenty of information\u2014such as pitch, loudness, and direction. Humans can normally hear frequencies ranging from approximately 20 to 20,000 Hz. Other animals have hearing ranges different from that of humans. Dogs can hear sounds as high as 45,000 Hz, whereas bats and dolphins can hear up to 110,000 Hz sounds. You may have noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog whistle which produces sound out of the range of human hearing.\n\nSounds below 20 Hz are called infrasound, whereas those above 20,000 Hz are ultrasound. The perception of frequency is called pitch, and the perception of intensity is called loudness.\n\nThe way we hear involves some interesting physics. The sound wave that hits our ear is a pressure wave. The ear converts sound waves into electrical nerve impulses, similar to a microphone.\n\nFigure 14.11 shows the anatomy of the ear with its division into three parts: the outer ear or ear canal; the middle ear, which runs from the eardrum to the cochlea; and the inner ear, which is the cochlea itself. The body part normally referred to as the ear is technically called the pinna.\n\nThe outer ear, or ear canal, carries sound to the eardrum protected inside of the ear. The middle ear converts sound into mechanical vibrations and applies these vibrations to the cochlea. The lever system of the middle ear takes the force exerted on the eardrum by sound pressure variations, amplifies it and transmits it to the inner ear via the oval window. Two muscles in the middle ear protect the inner ear from very intense sounds. They react to intense sound in a few milliseconds and reduce the force transmitted to the cochlea. This protective reaction can also be triggered by your own voice, so that humming during a fireworks display, for example, can reduce noise damage.\n\nFigure 14.12 shows the middle and inner ear in greater detail. As the middle ear bones vibrate, they vibrate the cochlea, which contains fluid. This creates pressure waves in the fluid that cause the tectorial membrane to vibrate. The motion of the tectorial membrane stimulates tiny cilia on specialized cells called hair cells. These hair cells, and their attached neurons, transform the motion of the tectorial membrane into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.\n\nThe tectorial membrane vibrates at different positions based on the frequency of the incoming sound. This allows us to detect the pitch of sound. Additional processing in the brain also allows us to determine which direction the sound is coming from (based on comparison of the sound\u2019s arrival time and intensity between our two ears).",

Sound intensity level in decibels (dB) is more relevant for how humans perceive sounds than sound intensity (in W/m2), even though sound intensity is the SI unit. Sound intensity level is not the same as sound intensity\u2014it tells you the level of the sound relative to a reference intensity rather than the actual intensity. Hearing is the perception of sound and involves that transformation of sound waves into vibrations of parts within the ear. These vibrations are then transformed into neural signals that are interpreted by the brain. People create sounds by pushing air up through their lungs and through elastic folds in the throat called vocal cords. ",

                    "context": "The Doppler effect is a change in the observed pitch of a sound, due to relative motion between the source and the observer. An example of the Doppler effect due to the motion of a source occurs when you are standing still, and the sound of a siren coming from an ambulance shifts from high-pitch to low-pitch as it passes by. The closer the ambulance is to you, the more sudden the shift. The faster the ambulance moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this shift in frequency for passing race cars, airplanes, and trains. An example of the Doppler effect with a stationary source and moving observer is if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the bell\u2019s frequency shift from high to low as you pass by.\n\nWhat causes the Doppler effect? Let\u2019s compare three different scenarios: Sound waves emitted by a stationary source (Figure 14.14), sound waves emitted by a moving source (Figure 14.15), and sound waves emitted by a stationary source but heard by moving observers (Figure 14.16). In each case, the sound spreads out from the point where it was emitted.\n\nIf the source and observers are stationary, then observers on either side see the same wavelength and frequency as emitted by the source. But if the source is moving and continues to emit sound as it travels, then the air compressions (crests) become closer together in the direction in which it\u2019s traveling and farther apart in the direction it\u2019s traveling away from. Therefore, the wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving (on the right in Figure 14.15), and longer in the opposite direction (on the left in Figure 14.15).\n\nFinally, if the observers move, as in Figure 14.16, the frequency at which they receive the compressions changes. The observer moving toward the source receives them at a higher frequency (and therefore shorter wavelength), and the person moving away from the source receives them at a lower frequency (and therefore longer wavelength).\n\nWe know that wavelength and frequency are related by  $$\\(v = f\\lambda\\text{,}\\)$$  where v is the fixed speed of sound. The sound moves in a medium and has the same speed v in that medium whether the source is moving or not. Therefore, f multiplied by  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$  is a constant. Because the observer on the right in Figure 14.15 receives a shorter wavelength, the frequency she perceives must be higher. Similarly, the observer on the left receives a longer wavelength and therefore perceives a lower frequency.\n\nThe same thing happens in Figure 14.16. A higher frequency is perceived by the observer moving toward the source, and a lower frequency is perceived by an observer moving away from the source. In general, then, relative motion of source and observer toward one another increases the perceived frequency. Relative motion apart decreases the perceived frequency. The greater the relative speed is, the greater the effect.\n\nFor a stationary observer and a moving source of sound, the frequency (fobs) of sound perceived by the observer is\n\n$$\\[f_{obs} = f_{s}\\left( \\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} \\pm v_{s}} \\right)\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere fs is the frequency of sound from a source, vs is the speed of the source along a line joining the source and observer, and vw is the speed of sound. The minus sign is used for motion toward the observer and the plus sign for motion away from the observer.\n\nNote that the greater the speed of the source, the greater the Doppler effect. Similarly, for a stationary source and moving observer, the frequency perceived by the observer fobs is given by\n\n$$\\[f_{obs} = f_{s}\\left( \\frac{v_{w} \\pm v_{obs}}{v_{w}} \\right)\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere vobs is the speed of the observer along a line joining the source and observer. Here the plus sign is for motion toward the source, and the minus sign is for motion away from the source.",

Suppose a jet airplane is coming nearly straight at you, emitting a sound of frequency fs. The greater the plane\u2019s speed, vs, the greater the Doppler shift and the greater the value of fobs. Now, as vs approaches the speed of sound, vw, fobs approaches infinity, because the denominator in  $$\\(f_{obs} = f_{s}\\left( \\frac{v_{w}}{v_{w} - v_{s}} \\right)\\)$$  approaches zero.\n\nThis result means that at the speed of sound, in front of the source, each wave is superimposed on the previous one because the source moves forward at the speed of sound. The observer gets them all at the same instant, and so the frequency is theoretically infinite. If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the observer until the source has passed, so that the sounds from the source when it was approaching are stacked up with those from it when receding, creating a sonic boom. A sonic boom is a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound.\n\nAn aircraft creates two sonic booms, one from its nose and one from its tail (see Figure 14.17). During television coverage of space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the shuttle to pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not observe the aircraft creating the sonic boom, because it has passed by before the shock wave reaches them. If the aircraft flies close by at low altitude, pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive enough to break windows. Because of this, supersonic flights are banned over populated areas of the United States.",

                    "context": "Sit in front of a piano sometime and sing a loud brief note at it while pushing down on the sustain pedal. It will sing the same note back at you\u2014the strings that have the same frequencies as your voice, are resonating in response to the forces from the sound waves that you sent to them. This is a good example of the fact that objects\u2014in this case, piano strings\u2014can be forced to oscillate but oscillate best at their natural frequency. \n\nA driving force (such as your voice in the example) puts energy into a system at a certain frequency, which is not necessarily the same as the natural frequency of the system. Over time the energy dissipates, and the amplitude gradually reduces to zero- this is called damping. The natural frequency is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no damping force. The phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called resonance, and a system being driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate.\n\nMost of us have played with toys where an object bobs up and down on an elastic band, something like the paddle ball suspended from a finger in Figure 14.18. At first you hold your finger steady, and the ball bounces up and down with a small amount of damping. If you move your finger up and down slowly, the ball will follow along without bouncing much on its own. As you increase the frequency at which you move your finger up and down, the ball will respond by oscillating with increasing amplitude. When you drive the ball at its natural frequency, the ball\u2019s oscillations increase in amplitude with each oscillation for as long as you drive it. As the driving frequency gets progressively higher than the resonant or natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller, until the oscillations nearly disappear and your finger simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball.\n\nAnother example is that when you tune a radio, you adjust its resonant frequency so that it oscillates only at the desired station\u2019s broadcast (driving) frequency. Also, a child on a swing is driven (pushed) by a parent at the swing\u2019s natural frequency to reach the maximum amplitude (height). In all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance.\n\nAll sound resonances are due to constructive and destructive interference. Only the resonant frequencies interfere constructively to form standing waves, while others interfere destructively and are absent. From the toot made by blowing over a bottle to the recognizability of a great singer\u2019s voice, resonance and standing waves play a vital role in sound.\n\nInterference happens to all types of waves, including sound waves. In fact, one way to support that something is a wave is to observe interference effects. Figure 14.19 shows a set of headphones that employs a clever use of sound interference to cancel noise. To get destructive interference, a fast electronic analysis is performed, and a second sound is introduced with its maxima and minima exactly reversed from the incoming noise.\n\nIn addition to resonance, superposition of waves can also create beats. Beats are produced by the superposition of two waves with slightly different frequencies but the same amplitude. The waves alternate in time between constructive interference and destructive interference, giving the resultant wave an amplitude that varies over time. (See the resultant wave in Figure 14.20).\n\nThis wave fluctuates in amplitude, or beats, with a frequency called the beat frequency. The equation for beat frequency is\n\n$$\\[f_{B} = \\left| {f_{1} - f_{2}} \\right|\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the two original waves. If the two frequencies of sound waves are similar, then what we hear is an average frequency that gets louder and softer at the beat frequency.",

                    "context": "Suppose we hold a tuning fork near the end of a tube that is closed at the other end, as shown in Figure 14.21, Figure 14.22, and Figure 14.23. If the tuning fork has just the right frequency, the air column in the tube resonates loudly, but at most frequencies it vibrates very little. This means that the air column has only certain natural frequencies. The figures show how a resonance at the lowest of these natural frequencies is formed. A disturbance travels down the tube at the speed of sound and bounces off the closed end. If the tube is just the right length, the reflected sound arrives back at the tuning fork exactly half a cycle later, and it interferes constructively with the continuing sound produced by the tuning fork. The incoming and reflected sounds form a standing wave in the tube as shown.\n\nThe standing wave formed in the tube has its maximum air displacement (an antinode) at the open end, and no displacement (a node) at the closed end. Recall from the last chapter on waves that motion is unconstrained at the antinode, and halted at the node. The distance from a node to an antinode is one-fourth of a wavelength, and this equals the length of the tube; therefore,  $$\\(\\lambda = \\ 4L\\)$$ . This same resonance can be produced by a vibration introduced at or near the closed end of the tube, as shown in Figure 14.24.\n\nSince maximum air displacements are possible at the open end and none at the closed end, there are other, shorter wavelengths that can resonate in the tube see Figure 14.25). Here the standing wave has three-fourths of its wavelength in the tube, or  $$\\(L = \\ \\left( {3/4} \\right)\\lambda\\prime\\)$$, so that  $$\\(\\lambda\\prime\\  = \\ 4L/3\\)$$ . There is a whole series of shorter-wavelength and higher-frequency sounds that resonate in the tube.\n\nWe use specific terms for the resonances in any system. The lowest resonant frequency is called the fundamental, while all higher resonant frequencies are called overtones. All resonant frequencies are multiples of the fundamental, and are called harmonics. The fundamental is the first harmonic, the first overtone is the second harmonic, and so on. Figure 14.26 shows the fundamental and the first three overtones (the first four harmonics) in a tube closed at one end.\n\nThe fundamental and overtones can be present at the same time in a variety of combinations. For example, the note middle C on a trumpet sounds very different from middle C on a clarinet, even though both instruments are basically modified versions of a tube closed at one end. The fundamental frequency is the same (and usually the most intense), but the overtones and their mix of intensities are different. This mix is what gives musical instruments (and human voices) their distinctive characteristics, whether they have air columns, strings, or drumheads. In fact, much of our speech is determined by shaping the cavity formed by the throat and mouth and positioning the tongue to adjust the fundamental and combination of overtones.",

                    "context": "We generally take light for granted, but it is a truly amazing and mysterious form of energy. Think about it: Light travels to Earth across millions of kilometers of empty space. When it reaches us, it interacts with matter in various ways to generate almost all the energy needed to support life, provide heat, and cause weather patterns. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation (EMR). The term light usually refers to visible light, but this is not the only form of EMR. As we will see, visible light occupies a narrow band in a broad range of types of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is generated by a moving electric charge, that is, by an electric current. As you will see when you study electricity, an electric current generates both an electric field, E, and a magnetic field, B. These fields are perpendicular to each other. When the moving charge oscillates, as in an alternating current, an EM wave is propagated. Figure 15.2 shows how an electromagnetic wave moves away from the source\u2014indicated by the ~ symbol.\n\nFrom your study of sound waves, recall these features that apply to all types of waves:\n\nWavelength\u2014The distance between two wave crests or two wave troughs, expressed in various metric measures of distance Frequency\u2014The number of wave crests that pass a point per second, expressed in hertz (Hz or s\u20131) Amplitude: The height of the crest above the null point \n\nAs mentioned, electromagnetic radiation takes several forms. These forms are characterized by a range of frequencies. Because frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, any form of EMR can also be represented by its range of wavelengths. Figure 15.3 shows the frequency and wavelength ranges of various types of EMR. With how many of these types are you familiar?\n\nTake a few minutes to study the positions of the various types of radiation on the EM spectrum, above. Sometimes all radiation with frequencies lower than those of visible light are referred to as infrared (IR) radiation. This includes radio waves, which overlap with the frequencies used for media broadcasts of TV and radio signals. The microwave radiation that you see on the diagram is the same radiation that is used in a microwave oven. What we feel as radiant heat is also a form of low-frequency EMR.\n\nAll the high-frequency radiation to the right of visible light is sometimes referred to as ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This includes X-rays and gamma (\u03b3) rays. The narrow band that is visible light extends from lower-frequency red light to higher-frequency violet light, thus the terms are infrared (below red) and ultraviolet (beyond violet).",

                    "context": "All the EM waves mentioned above are basically the same form of radiation. They can all travel across empty space, and they all travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. The basic difference between types of radiation is their differing frequencies. Each frequency has an associated wavelength. As frequency increases across the spectrum, wavelength decreases. Energy also increases with frequency. Because of this, higher frequencies penetrate matter more readily. Some of the properties and uses of the various EM spectrum bands are listed in Table 15.1.\n\nThe narrow band of visible light is a combination of the colors of the rainbow. Figure 15.5 shows the section of the EM spectrum that includes visible light. The frequencies corresponding to these wavelengths are  $$\\(4.0\\  \\times \\ 10^{14}\\text{~s}^{-1}\\)$$  at the red end to  $$\\(7.9\\  \\times \\ 10^{14}\\text{~s}^{-1}\\)$$  at the violet end. This is a very narrow range, considering that the EM spectrum spans about 20 orders of magnitude.\n\nAs a child, you probably learned the color wheel, shown on the left in Figure 15.6. It helps if you know what color results when you mix different colors of paint together. Mixing two of the primary pigment colors\u2014magenta, yellow, or cyan\u2014together results in a secondary color. For example, mixing cyan and yellow makes green. This is called subtractive color mixing. Mixing different colors of light together is quite different. The diagram on the right shows additive color mixing. In this case, the primary colors are red, green, and blue, and the secondary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. Mixing pigments and mixing light are different because materials absorb light by a different set of rules than does the perception of light by the eye. Notice that, when all colors are subtracted, the result is no color, or black. When all colors are added, the result is white light. We see the reverse of this when white sunlight is separated into the visible spectrum by a prism or by raindrops when a rainbow appears in the sky.\n\nHumans have found uses for every part of the electromagnetic spectrum. We will take a look at the uses of each range of frequencies, beginning with visible light. Most of our uses of visible light are obvious; without it our interaction with our surroundings would be much different. We might forget that nearly all of our food depends on the photosynthesis process in plants, and that the energy for this process comes from the visible part of the spectrum. Without photosynthesis, we would also have almost no oxygen in the atmosphere.\n\nThe low-frequency, infrared region of the spectrum has many applications in media broadcasting. Television, radio, cell phone, and remote-control devices all broadcast and/or receive signals with these wavelengths. AM and FM radio signals are both low-frequency radiation. They are in different regions of the spectrum, but that is not their basic difference. AM and FM are abbreviations for amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. Information in AM signals has the form of changes in amplitude of the radio waves; information in FM signals has the form of changes in wave frequency.\n\nAnother application of long-wavelength radiation is found in microwave ovens. These appliances cook or warm food by irradiating it with EM radiation in the microwave frequency range. Most kitchen microwaves use a frequency of  $$\\(2.45\\  \\times \\ 10^{9}\\)$$ Hz. These waves have the right amount of energy to cause polar molecules, such as water, to rotate faster. Polar molecules are those that have a partial charge separation. The rotational energy of these molecules is given up to surrounding matter as heat. The first microwave ovens were called Radaranges because they were based on radar technology  developed during World War II.\n\nRadar uses radiation with wavelengths similar to those of microwaves to detect the location and speed of distant objects, such as airplanes, weather formations, and motor vehicles. Radar information is obtained by receiving and analyzing the echoes of microwaves reflected by an object. The speed of the object can be measured using the Doppler shift of the returning waves. This is the same effect you learned about when you studied sound waves. Like sound waves, EM waves are shifted to higher frequencies by an object moving toward an observer, and to lower frequencies by an object moving away from the observer. Astronomers use this same Doppler effect to measure the speed at which distant galaxies are moving away from us. In this case, the shift in frequency is called the red shift, because visible frequencies are shifted toward the lower-frequency, red end of the spectrum.\n\nExposure to any radiation with frequencies greater than those of visible light carries some health hazards. All types of radiation in this range are known to cause cell damage. The danger is related to the high energy and penetrating ability of these EM waves. The likelihood of being harmed by any of this radiation depends largely on the amount of exposure. Most people try to reduce exposure to UV radiation from sunlight by using sunscreen and protective clothing. Physicians still use X-rays to diagnose medical problems, but the intensity of the radiation used is extremely low. Figure 15.8 shows an X-ray image of a patient\u2019s chest cavity.\n\nOne medical-imaging technique that involves no danger of exposure is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is an important imaging and research tool in medicine, producing highly detailed two- and three-dimensional images. Radio waves are broadcast, absorbed, and reemitted in a resonance process that is sensitive to the density of nuclei, usually hydrogen nuclei\u2014protons.",

                    "context": "In a vacuum, all electromagnetic radiation travels at the same incredible speed of 3.00 \u00d7 108 m/s, which is equal to 671 million miles per hour. This is one of the fundamental physical constants. It is referred to as the speed of light and is given the symbol c. The space between celestial bodies is a near vacuum, so the light we see from the Sun, stars, and other planets has traveled here at the speed of light. Keep in mind that all EM radiation travels at this speed. All the different wavelengths of radiation that leave the Sun make the trip to Earth in the same amount of time. That trip takes 8.3 minutes. Light from the nearest star, besides the Sun, takes 4.2 years to reach Earth, and light from the nearest galaxy\u2014a dwarf galaxy that orbits the Milky Way\u2014travels 25,000 years on its way to Earth. You can see why we call very long distances astronomical. \n\nWhen light travels through a physical medium, its speed is always less than the speed of light. For example, light travels in water at three-fourths the value of c. In air, light has a speed that is just slightly slower than in empty space: 99.97 percent of c. Diamond slows light down to just 41 percent of c. When light changes speeds at a boundary between media, it also changes direction. The greater the difference in speeds, the more the path of light bends. In other chapters, we look at this bending, called refraction, in greater detail. We introduce refraction here to help explain a phenomenon called thin-film interference.\n\nHave you ever wondered about the rainbow colors you often see on soap bubbles, oil slicks, and compact discs? This occurs when light is both refracted by and reflected from a very thin film. The diagram shows the path of light through such a thin film. The symbols n1, n2, and n3 indicate that light travels at different speeds in each of the three materials. Learn more about this topic in the chapter on diffraction and interference.\n\nFigure 15.9 shows the result of thin film interference on the surface of soap bubbles. Because ray 2 travels a greater distance, the two rays become out of phase. That is, the crests of the two emerging waves are no longer moving together. This causes interference, which reinforces the intensity of the wavelengths of light that create the bands of color. The color bands are separated because each color has a different wavelength. Also, the thickness of the film is not uniform, and different thicknesses cause colors of different wavelengths to interfere in different places. Note that the film must be very, very thin\u2014somewhere in the vicinity of the wavelengths of visible light.\n\nYou have probably experienced how polarized sunglasses reduce glare from the surface of water or snow. The effect is caused by the wave nature of light. Looking back at Figure 15.2, we see that the electric field moves in only one direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Light from most sources vibrates in all directions perpendicular to propagation. Light with an electric field that vibrates in only one direction is called polarized. A diagram of polarized light would look like Figure 15.2. \n\nPolarized glasses are an example of a polarizing filter. These glasses absorb most of the horizontal light waves and transmit the vertical waves. This cuts down glare, which is caused by horizontal waves. Figure 15.10 shows how waves traveling along a rope can be used as a model of how a polarizing filter works. The oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane and are said to be vertically polarized. Those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane and are horizontally polarized. If a vertical slit is placed on the first rope, the waves pass through. However, a vertical slit blocks the horizontally polarized waves. For EM waves, the direction of the electric field oscillation is analogous to the disturbances on the ropes.\n\nLight can also be polarized by reflection. Most of the light reflected from water, glass, or any highly reflective surface is polarized horizontally. Figure 15.11 shows the effect of a polarizing lens on light reflected from the surface of water.",

If we know the distance to a celestial object, we can calculate how long it takes its light to reach us. Of course, we can also make the reverse calculation if we know the time it takes for the light to travel to us. For an object at a very great distance from Earth, it takes many years for its light to reach us. This means that we are looking at the object as it existed in the distant past. The object may, in fact, no longer exist. Very large distances in the universe are measured in light years. One light year is the distance that light travels in one year, which is  $$\\(9.46\\  \\times \\ 10^{12}\\)$$ kilometers or $$\\(5.88\\  \\times \\ 10^{12}\\)$$ miles (\u2026and 1012 is a trillion!).\n\nA useful equation involving c is\n\n$$\\[c = f\\lambda\\]$$\n\nwhere f is frequency in Hz, and  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$  is wavelength in meters.\n\nThe rate at which light is radiated from a source is called luminous flux, P, and it is measured in lumens (lm). Energy-saving light bulbs, which provide more luminous flux for a given use of electricity, are now available. One of these bulbs is called a compact fluorescent lamp; another is an LED (light-emitting diode) bulb. If you wanted to replace an old incandescent bulb with an energy saving bulb, you would want the new bulb to have the same brightness as the old one. To compare bulbs accurately, you would need to compare the lumens each one puts out. Comparing wattage\u2014that is, the electric power used\u2014would be misleading. Both wattage and lumens are stated on the packaging.\n\nThe luminous flux of a bulb might be 2,000 lm. That accounts for all the light radiated in all directions. However, what we really need to know is how much light falls on an object, such as a book, at a specific distance. The number of lumens per square meter is called illuminance, and is given in units of lux (lx). Picture a light bulb in the middle of a sphere with a 1-m radius. The total surface of the sphere equals 4\u03c0r2 m2. The illuminance then is given by\n\n$$\\[{\\text{illuminance~=}\\ \\frac{P}{4\\pi r^{2}}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nWhat happens if the radius of the sphere is increased 2 m? The illuminance is now only one-fourth as great, because the r2 term in the denominator is 4 instead of 1. Figure 15.12 shows how illuminance decreases with the inverse square of the distance.",

                    "context": "There are three ways, as shown in Figure 16.2, in which light can travel from a source to another location. It can come directly from the source through empty space, such as from the Sun to Earth. Light can travel to an object through various media, such as air and glass. Light can also arrive at an object after being reflected, such as by a mirror. In all these cases, light is modeled as traveling in a straight line, called a ray. Light may change direction when it encounters the surface of a different material (such as a mirror) or when it passes from one material to another (such as when passing from air into glass). It then continues in a straight line\u2014that is, as a ray. The word ray comes from mathematics. Here it means a straight line that originates from some point. It is acceptable to visualize light rays as laser rays (or even science fiction depictions of ray guns).\n\nBecause light moves in straight lines, that is, as rays, and changes directions when it interacts with matter, it can be described through geometry and trigonometry. This part of optics, described by straight lines and angles, is therefore called geometric optics. There are two laws that govern how light changes direction when it interacts with matter: the law of reflection, for situations in which light bounces off matter; and the law of refraction, for situations in which light passes through matter. In this section, we consider the geometric optics of reflection.\n\nWhenever we look into a mirror or squint at sunlight glinting from a lake, we are seeing a reflection. How does the reflected light travel from the object to your eyes? The law of reflection states: The angle of reflection,  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{r}}\\)$$, equals the angle of incidence,  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{i}}\\)$$. This law governs the behavior of all waves when they interact with a smooth surface, and therefore describe the behavior of light waves as well. The reflection of light is simplified when light is treated as a ray. This concept is illustrated in Figure 16.3, which also shows how the angles are measured relative to the line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray strikes it. This perpendicular line is also called the normal line, or just the normal. Light reflected in this way is referred to as specular (from the Latin word for mirror: speculum).\n\nWe expect to see reflections from smooth surfaces, but Figure 16.4, illustrates how a rough surface reflects light. Because the light is reflected from different parts of the surface at different angles, the rays go in many different directions, so the reflected light is diffused. Diffused light allows you to read a printed page from almost any angle because some of the rays go in different directions. Many objects, such as people, clothing, leaves, and walls, have rough surfaces and can be seen from many angles. A mirror, on the other hand, has a smooth surface and reflects light at specific angles.\n\nWhen we see ourselves in a mirror, it appears that our image is actually behind the mirror. We see the light coming from a direction determined by the law of reflection. The angles are such that our image is exactly the same distance behind the mirror, di, as the distance we stand away from the mirror, do. Although these mirror images make objects appear to be where they cannot be (such as behind a solid wall), the images are not figments of our imagination. Mirror images can be photographed and videotaped by instruments and look just as they do to our eyes, which are themselves optical instruments. An image in a mirror is said to be a virtual image, as opposed to a real image. A virtual image is formed when light rays appear to diverge from a point without actually doing so.\n\nFigure 16.5 helps illustrate how a flat mirror forms an image. Two rays are shown emerging from the same point, striking the mirror, and reflecting into the observer\u2019s eye. The rays can diverge slightly, and both still enter the eye. If the rays are extrapolated backward, they seem to originate from a common point behind the mirror, allowing us to locate the image. The paths of the reflected rays into the eye are the same as if they had come directly from that point behind the mirror. Using the law of reflection\u2014the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence\u2014we can see that the image and object are the same distance from the mirror. This is a virtual image, as defined earlier.\n\nSome mirrors are curved instead of flat. A mirror that curves inward is called a concave mirror, whereas one that curves outward is called a convex mirror. Pick up a well-polished metal spoon and you can see an example of each type of curvature. The side of the spoon that holds the food is a concave mirror; the back of the spoon is a convex mirror. Observe your image on both sides of the spoon.\n\nRay diagrams can be used to find the point where reflected rays converge or appear to converge, or the point from which rays appear to diverge. This is called the focal point, F. The distance from F to the mirror along the central axis (the line perpendicular to the center of the mirror\u2019s surface) is called the focal length, f. Figure 16.9 shows the focal points of concave and convex mirrors.\n\nImages formed by a concave mirror vary, depending on which side of the focal point the object is placed. For any object placed on the far side of the focal point with respect to the mirror, the rays converge in front of the mirror to form a real image, which can be projected onto a surface, such as a screen or sheet of paper However, for an object located inside the focal point with respect to the concave mirror, the image is virtual. For a convex mirror the image is always virtual\u2014that is, it appears to be behind the mirror. The ray diagrams in Figure 16.10 show how to determine the nature of the image formed by concave and convex mirrors.\n\nThe information in Figure 16.10 is summarized in Table 16.1.\n\n\n\nYou should be able to notice everyday applications of curved mirrors. One common example is the use of security mirrors in stores, as shown in Figure 16.11.\n\nSome telescopes also use curved mirrors and no lenses (except in the eyepieces) both to magnify images and to change the path of light. Figure 16.12 shows a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. This design uses a spherical primary concave mirror and a convex secondary mirror. The image is projected onto the focal plane by light passing through the perforated primary mirror. The effective focal length of such a telescope is the focal length of the primary mirror multiplied by the magnification of the secondary mirror. The result is a telescope with a focal length much greater than the length of the telescope itself.\n\nA parabolic concave mirror has the very useful property that all light from a distant source, on reflection by the mirror surface, is directed to the focal point. Likewise, a light source placed at the focal point directs all the light it emits in parallel lines away from the mirror. This case is illustrated by the ray diagram in Figure 16.13. The light source in a car headlight, for example, is located at the focal point of a parabolic mirror.\n\nParabolic mirrors are also used to collect sunlight and direct it to a focal point, where it is transformed into heat, which in turn can be used to generate electricity. This application is shown in Figure 16.14.",

The signs of these values indicate whether the image is inverted, erect (upright), real, or virtual. We now look at the equations that relate these variables and apply them to everyday problems.\n\nFigure 16.15 shows the meanings of most of the variables we will use for calculations involving curved mirrors.\n\nThe basic equation that describes both lenses and mirrors is the lens/mirror equation\n\n$$\\[\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_{i}} + \\frac{1}{d_{o}}.\\]$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged several ways. For example, it may be written to solve for focal length.\n\n$$\\[f = \\frac{d_{i}d_{o}}{d_{o} + d_{i}}\\]$$\n\nMagnification, m, is the ratio of the size of the image, hi, to the size of the object, ho. The value of m can be calculated in two ways.\n\n$$\\[m = \\frac{h_{i}}{h_{o}} = \\frac{- d_{i}}{d_{o}}\\]$$\n\nThis relationship can be written to solve for any of the variables involved. For example, the height of the image is given by\n\n$$\\[h_{i} = - h_{o}\\left( \\frac{d_{i}}{d_{o}} \\right).\\]$$\n\nWe saved the simplest equation for last. The radius of curvature of a curved mirror, R, is simply twice the focal length.\n\n$$\\[R = 2f\\]$$\n\nWe can learn important information from the algebraic sign of the result of a calculation using the previous equations:\n\nA negative di indicates a virtual image; a positive value indicates a real image A negative hi indicates an inverted image; a positive value indicates an erect image For concave mirrors, f is positive; for convex mirrors, f is negative \n\nNow let\u2019s apply these equations to solve some problems.",

For example, you may see the same fish appear to be in two different places (Figure 16.16). This is because light coming to you from the fish changes direction when it leaves the tank and, in this case, light rays traveling along two different paths both reach our eyes. The changing of a light ray\u2019s direction (loosely called bending) when it passes a boundary between materials of different composition, or between layers in single material where there are changes in temperature and density, is called refraction. Refraction is responsible for a tremendous range of optical phenomena, from the action of lenses to voice transmission through optical fibers.\n\nWhy does light change direction when passing from one material (medium) to another? It is because light changes speed when going from one material to another. This behavior is typical of all waves and is especially easy to apply to light because light waves have very small wavelengths, and so they can be treated as rays. Before we study the law of refraction, it is useful to discuss the speed of light and how it varies between different media.\n\nThe speed of light is now known to great precision. In fact, the speed of light in a vacuum, c, is so important, and is so precisely known, that it is accepted as one of the basic physical quantities, and has the fixed value\n\n$$\\[c = 2.9972458\\  \\times \\ 10^{8}\\text{m/s} \\approx 3.00\\  \\times \\ 10^{8}\\text{m/s}\\]$$\n\nwhere the approximate value of 3.00  $$\\(\\times\\)$$  108 m/s is used whenever three-digit precision is sufficient. The speed of light through matter is less than it is in a vacuum, because light interacts with atoms in a material. The speed of light depends strongly on the type of material, given that its interaction with different atoms, crystal lattices, and other substructures varies. We define the index of refraction, n, of a material to be\n\n$$\\[n = \\frac{c}{v},\\]$$\n\nwhere v is the observed speed of light in the material. Because the speed of light is always less than c in matter and equals c only in a vacuum, the index of refraction (plural: indices of refraction) is always greater than or equal to one.\n\nTable 16.2 lists the indices of refraction in various common materials.\n\nFigure 16.17 provides an analogy for and a description of how a ray of light changes direction when it passes from one medium to another. As in the previous section, the angles are measured relative to a perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray crosses it. The change in direction of the light ray depends on how the speed of light changes. The change in the speed of light is related to the indices of refraction of the media involved. In the situations shown in Figure 16.17, medium 2 has a greater index of refraction than medium 1. This difference in index of refraction means that the speed of light is less in medium 2 than in medium 1. Note that, in Figure 16.17(a), the path of the ray moves closer to the perpendicular when the ray slows down. Conversely, in Figure 16.17(b), the path of the ray moves away from the perpendicular when the ray speeds up. The path is exactly reversible. In both cases, you can imagine what happens by thinking about pushing a lawn mower from a footpath onto grass, and vice versa. Going from the footpath to grass, the right front wheel is slowed and pulled to the side as shown. This is the same change in direction for light when it goes from a fast medium to a slow one. When going from the grass to the footpath, the left front wheel moves faster than the others, and the mower changes direction as shown. This, too, is the same change in direction as light going from slow to fast.\n\nThe amount that a light ray changes direction depends both on the incident angle and the amount that the speed changes. For a ray at a given incident angle, a large change in speed causes a large change in direction, and thus a large change in the angle of refraction. The exact mathematical relationship is the law of refraction, or Snell\u2019s law, which is stated in equation form as\n\n$$\\[n_{1}\\sin\\theta_{1} = n_{2}\\sin\\theta_{2}\\text{~or~}\\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}} = \\frac{\\text{sin}\\theta_{2}}{\\text{sin}\\theta_{1}}.\\]$$\n\nIn terms of speeds, Snell\u2019s law becomes\n\n$$\\[\\frac{\\sin\\theta_{1}}{\\sin\\theta_{2}} = \\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}.\\]$$\n\nHere, n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction for media 1 and 2, respectively, and \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the angles between the rays and the perpendicular in the respective media 1 and 2, as shown in Figure 16.17. The incoming ray is called the incident ray and the outgoing ray is called the refracted ray. The associated angles are called the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. Later, we apply Snell\u2019s law to some practical situations.\n\nDispersion is defined as the spreading of white light into the wavelengths of which it is composed. This happens because the index of refraction varies slightly with wavelength. Figure 16.18 shows how a prism disperses white light into the colors of the rainbow.\n\nRainbows are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection. You may have noticed that you see a rainbow only when you turn your back to the Sun. Light enters a drop of water and is reflected from the back of the drop, as shown in Figure 16.19. The light is refracted both as it enters and as it leaves the drop. Because the index of refraction of water varies with wavelength, the light is dispersed and a rainbow is observed.\n\nA good-quality mirror reflects more than 90 percent of the light that falls on it; the mirror absorbs the rest. But, it would be useful to have a mirror that reflects all the light that falls on it. Interestingly, we can produce total reflection using an aspect of refraction. Consider what happens when a ray of light strikes the surface between two materials, such as is shown in Figure 16.20(a). Part of the light crosses the boundary and is refracted; the rest is reflected. If, as shown in the figure, the index of refraction for the second medium is less than the first, the ray bends away from the perpendicular. Because n1 > n2, the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of incidence\u2014that is,  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{2}}\\)$$ > $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{1}}\\)$$ . Now, imagine what happens as the incident angle is increased. This causes  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{2}}\\)$$  to increase as well. The largest the angle of refraction,  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{2}}\\)$$, can be is 90\u00b0, as shown in Figure 16.20(b). The critical angle,  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{c}}\\)$$, for a combination of two materials is defined to be the incident angle,  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{1}}\\)$$, which produces an angle of refraction of 90\u00b0. That is,  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{c}}\\)$$  is the incident angle for which  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{2}}\\)$$ = 90\u00b0. If the incident angle,  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{1}}\\)$$, is greater than the critical angle, as shown in Figure 16.20(c), then all the light is reflected back into medium 1, a condition called total internal reflection.\n\nRecall that Snell\u2019s law states the relationship between angles and indices of refraction. It is given by\n\n$$\\[n_{1}\\sin\\theta_{1} = n_{2}\\sin\\theta_{2}.\\]$$\n\nWhen the incident angle equals the critical angle ( $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{1}}\\)$$= $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{c}}\\)$$), the angle of refraction is 90\u00b0 ( $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{2}}\\)$$= 90\u00b0). Noting that sin 90\u00b0 = 1, Snell\u2019s law in this case becomes\n\n$$\\[n_{1}\\sin\\theta_{1} = n_{2}.\\]$$\n\nThe critical angle,  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{c}}\\)$$, for a given combination of materials is thus\n\n$$\\[\\theta_{c} = \\sin^{- 1}\\left( \\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} \\right)\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nfor n1 > n2.\n\nTotal internal reflection occurs for any incident angle greater than the critical angle,  $$\\(\\theta_{\\text{c}}\\)$$, and it can only occur when the second medium has an index of refraction less than the first. Note that the previous equation is written for a light ray that travels in medium 1 and reflects from medium 2, as shown in Figure 16.20.\n\nThere are several important applications of total internal reflection. Total internal reflection, coupled with a large index of refraction, explains why diamonds sparkle more than other materials. The critical angle for a diamond-to-air surface is only 24.4\u00b0; so, when light enters a diamond, it has trouble getting back out (Figure 16.21). Although light freely enters the diamond at different angles, it can exit only if it makes an angle less than 24.4\u00b0 with the normal to a given surface. Facets on diamonds are specifically intended to make this unlikely, so that the light can exit only in certain places. Diamonds with very few impurities are very clear, so the light makes many internal reflections and is concentrated at the few places it can exit\u2014hence the sparkle.\n\nA light ray that strikes an object that consists of two mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces is reflected back exactly parallel to the direction from which it came. This parallel reflection is true whenever the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular, and it is independent of the angle of incidence. Such an object is called a corner reflector because the light bounces from its inside corner. Many inexpensive reflector buttons on bicycles, cars, and warning signs have corner reflectors designed to return light in the direction from which it originates. Corner reflectors are perfectly efficient when the conditions for total internal reflection are satisfied. With common materials, it is easy to obtain a critical angle that is less than 45\u00b0. One use of these perfect mirrors is in binoculars, as shown in Figure 16.22. Another application is for periscopes used in submarines.\n\nFiber optics are one common application of total internal reflection. In communications, fiber optics are used to transmit telephone, internet, and cable TV signals, and they use the transmission of light down fibers of plastic or glass. Because the fibers are thin, light entering one is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle and, thus, be totally reflected (Figure 16.23). The index of refraction outside the fiber must be smaller than inside, a condition that is satisfied easily by coating the outside of the fiber with a material that has an appropriate refractive index. In fact, most fibers have a varying refractive index to allow more light to be guided along the fiber through total internal reflection. Rays are reflected around corners as shown in the figure, making the fibers into tiny light pipes.",

                    "context": "Lenses are found in a huge array of optical instruments, ranging from a simple magnifying glass to the eye to a camera\u2019s zoom lens. In this section, we use the law of refraction to explore the properties of lenses and how they form images.\n\nSome of what we learned in the earlier discussion of curved mirrors also applies to the study of lenses. Concave, convex, focal point F, and focal length f have the same meanings as before, except each measurement is made from the center of the lens instead of the surface of the mirror. The convex lens shown in Figure 16.25 has been shaped so that all light rays that enter it parallel to its central axis cross one another at a single point on the opposite side of the lens. The central axis, or axis, is defined to be a line normal to the lens at its center. Such a lens is called a converging lens because of the converging effect it has on light rays. An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown in Figure 16.25 to illustrate how the ray changes direction both as it enters and as it leaves the lens. Because the index of refraction of the lens is greater than that of air, the ray moves toward the perpendicular as it enters and away from the perpendicular as it leaves. (This is in accordance with the law of refraction.) As a result of the shape of the lens, light is thus bent toward the axis at both surfaces.\n\nNote that rays from a light source placed at the focal point of a converging lens emerge parallel from the other side of the lens. You may have heard of the trick of using a converging lens to focus rays of sunlight to a point. Such a concentration of light energy can produce enough heat to ignite paper.\n\nFigure 16.26 shows a concave lens and the effect it has on rays of light that enter it parallel to its axis (the path taken by ray 2 in the figure is the axis of the lens). The concave lens is a diverging lens because it causes the light rays to bend away (diverge) from its axis. In this case, the lens has been shaped so all light rays entering it parallel to its axis appear to originate from the same point, F, defined to be the focal point of a diverging lens. The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is again called the focal length, or \u201c\u0192,\u201d of the lens. Note that the focal length of a diverging lens is defined to be negative. An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown in Figure 16.26 to illustrate how the shape of the lens, together with the law of refraction, causes the ray to follow its particular path and diverge.\n\nThe power, P, of a lens is very easy to calculate. It is simply the reciprocal of the focal length, expressed in meters\n\n$$\\[P = \\frac{1}{f}.\\]$$\n\nThe units of power are diopters, D, which are expressed in reciprocal meters. If the focal length is negative, as it is for the diverging lens in Figure 16.26, then the power is also negative.\n\nIn some circumstances, a lens forms an image at an obvious location, such as when a movie projector casts an image onto a screen. In other cases, the image location is less obvious. Where, for example, is the image formed by eyeglasses? We use ray tracing for thin lenses to illustrate how they form images, and we develop equations to describe the image-formation quantitatively. These are the rules for ray tracing:\n\nA ray entering a converging lens parallel to its axis passes through the focal point, F, of the lens on the other side A ray entering a diverging lens parallel to its axis seems to come from the focal point, F, on the side of the entering ray A ray passing through the center of either a converging or a diverging lens does not change direction A ray entering a converging lens through its focal point exits parallel to its axis A ray that enters a diverging lens by heading toward the focal point on the opposite side exits parallel to the axis \n\nConsider an object some distance away from a converging lens, as shown in Figure 16.27. To find the location and size of the image formed, we trace the paths of select light rays originating from one point on the object. In this example, the originating point is the top of a woman\u2019s head. Figure 16.27 shows three rays from the top of the object that can be traced using the ray-tracing rules just listed. Rays leave this point traveling in many directions, but we concentrate on only a few, which have paths that are easy to trace. The first ray is one that enters the lens parallel to its axis and passes through the focal point on the other side (rule 1). The second ray passes through the center of the lens without changing direction (rule 3). The third ray passes through the nearer focal point on its way into the lens and leaves the lens parallel to its axis (rule 4). All rays that come from the same point on the top of the person\u2019s head are refracted in such a way as to cross at the same point on the other side of the lens. The image of the top of the person\u2019s head is located at this point. Rays from another point on the object, such as the belt buckle, also cross at another common point, forming a complete image, as shown. Although three rays are traced in Figure 16.27, only two are necessary to locate the image. It is best to trace rays for which there are simple ray-tracing rules. Before applying ray tracing to other situations, let us consider the example shown in Figure 16.27 in more detail.\n\nThe image formed in Figure 16.27 is a real image\u2014meaning, it can be projected. That is, light rays from one point on the object actually cross at the location of the image and can be projected onto a screen, a piece of film, or the retina of an eye.\n\nIn Figure 16.27, the object distance, do, is greater than f. Now we consider a ray diagram for a convex lens where do< f, and another diagram for a concave lens.\n\nThe examples in Figure 16.27 and Figure 16.28 represent the three possible cases\u2014case 1, case 2, and case 3\u2014summarized in Table 16.3. In the table, m is magnification; the other symbols have the same meaning as they did for curved mirrors.\n\nImage formation by lenses can also be calculated from simple equations. We learn how these calculations are carried out near the end of this section.\n\nSome common applications of lenses with which we are all familiar are magnifying glasses, eyeglasses, cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. We take a look at the latter two examples, which are the most complex. We have already seen the design of a telescope that uses only mirrors in Figure 16.12. Figure 16.29 shows the design of a telescope that uses two lenses. Part (a) of the figure shows the design of the telescope used by Galileo. It produces an upright image, which is more convenient for many applications. Part (b) shows an arrangement of lenses used in many astronomical telescopes. This design produces an inverted image, which is less of a problem when viewing celestial objects.\n\nFigure 16.30 shows the path of light through a typical microscope. Microscopes were first developed during the early 1600s by eyeglass makers in the Netherlands and Denmark. The simplest compound microscope is constructed from two convex lenses, as shown schematically in Figure 16.30. The first lens is called the objective lens; it has typical magnification values from 5 $$\\(\\times\\)$$  to 100 $$\\(\\times\\)$$ . In standard microscopes, the objectives are mounted such that when you switch between them, the sample remains in focus. Objectives arranged in this way are described as parfocal. The second lens, the eyepiece, also referred to as the ocular, has several lenses that slide inside a cylindrical barrel. The focusing ability is provided by the movement of both the objective lens and the eyepiece. The purpose of a microscope is to magnify small objects, and both lenses contribute to the final magnification. In addition, the final enlarged image is produced in a location far enough from the observer to be viewed easily because the eye cannot focus on objects or images that are too close.\n\nReal lenses behave somewhat differently from how they are modeled using rays diagrams or the thin-lens equations. Real lenses produce aberrations. An aberration is a distortion in an image. There are a variety of aberrations that result from lens size, material, thickness, and the position of the object. One common type of aberration is chromatic aberration, which is related to color. Because the index of refraction of lenses depends on color, or wavelength, images are produced at different places and with different magnifications for different colors. The law of reflection is independent of wavelength, so mirrors do not have this problem. This result is another advantage for the use of mirrors in optical systems such as telescopes.\n\nFigure 16.31(a) shows chromatic aberration for a single convex lens, and its partial correction with a two-lens system. The index of refraction of the lens increases with decreasing wavelength, so violet rays are refracted more than red rays, and are thus focused closer to the lens. The diverging lens corrects this in part, although it is usually not possible to do so completely. Lenses made of different materials and with different dispersions may be used. For example, an achromatic doublet consisting of a converging lens made of crown glass in contact with a diverging lens made of flint glass can reduce chromatic aberration dramatically (Figure 16.31(b)).",

                    "context": "The eye is perhaps the most interesting of all optical instruments. It is remarkable in how it forms images and in the richness of detail and color they eye can detect. However, our eyes commonly need some correction to reach what is called normal vision, but should be called ideal vision instead. Image formation by our eyes and common vision correction are easy to analyze using geometric optics. Figure 16.32 shows the basic anatomy of the eye. The cornea and lens form a system that, to a good approximation, acts as a single thin lens. For clear vision, a real image must be projected onto the light-sensitive retina, which lies at a fixed distance from the lens. The lens of the eye adjusts its power to produce an image on the retina for objects at different distances. The center of the image falls on the fovea, which has the greatest density of light receptors and the greatest acuity (sharpness) in the visual field. There are no receptors at the place where the optic nerve meets the eye, which is called the blind spot. An image falling on this spot cannot be seen. The variable opening (or pupil) of the eye along with chemical adaptation allows the eye to detect light intensities from the lowest observable to 1010 times greater (without damage). Ten orders of magnitude is an incredible range of detection. Our eyes perform a vast number of functions, such as sense direction, movement, sophisticated colors, and distance. Processing of visual nerve impulses begins with interconnections in the retina and continues in the brain. The optic nerve conveys signals received by the eye to the brain.\n\nRefractive indices are crucial to image formation using lenses. Table 16.4 shows refractive indices relevant to the eye. The biggest change in the refractive index\u2014and the one that causes the greatest bending of rays\u2014occurs at the cornea rather than the lens. The ray diagram in Figure 16.33 shows image formation by the cornea and lens of the eye. The rays bend according to the refractive indices provided in Table 16.4. The cornea provides about two-thirds of the magnification of the eye because the speed of light changes considerably while traveling from air into the cornea. The lens provides the remaining magnification needed to produce an image on the retina. The cornea and lens can be treated as a single thin lens, although the light rays pass through several layers of material (such as the cornea, aqueous humor, several layers in the lens, and vitreous humor), changing direction at each interface. The image formed is much like the one produced by a single convex lens. This result is a case 1 image. Images formed in the eye are inverted, but the brain inverts them once more to make them seem upright.\n\nAs noted, the image must fall precisely on the retina to produce clear vision\u2014that is, the image distance, di, must equal the lens-to-retina distance. Because the lens-to-retina distance does not change, di must be the same for objects at all distances. The eye manages to vary the distance by varying the power (and focal length) of the lens to accommodate for objects at various distances. In Figure 16.33, you can see the small ciliary muscles above and below the lens that change the shape of the lens and, thus, the focal length.\n\nThe need for some type of vision correction is very common. Common vision defects are easy to understand, and some are simple to correct. Figure 16.34 illustrates two common vision defects. Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the inability to see distant objects clearly while close objects are in focus. The nearsighted eye overconverges the nearly parallel rays from a distant object, and the rays cross in front of the retina. More divergent rays from a close object are converged on the retina, producing a clear image. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the inability to see close objects clearly whereas distant objects may be in focus. A farsighted eye does not converge rays from a close object sufficiently to make the rays meet on the retina. Less divergent rays from a distant object can be converged for a clear image.\n\nBecause the nearsighted eye overconverges light rays, the correction for nearsightedness involves placing a diverging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This lens reduces the power of an eye that has too short a focal length (Figure 16.35(a)). Because the farsighted eye underconverges light rays, the correction for farsightedness is to place a converging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This lens increases the power of an eye that has too long a focal length (Figure 16.35(b)).",

                    "context": "As promised, there are no new equations to memorize. We can use equations already presented for solving problems involving curved mirrors. Careful analysis allows you to apply these equations to lenses. Here are the equations you need\n\n$$\\[P = \\frac{1}{f},\\]$$\n\nwhere P is power, expressed in reciprocal meters (m\u20131) rather than diopters (D), and f is focal length, expressed in meters (m). You also need\n\n$$\\[\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_{i}} + \\frac{1}{d_{o}},\\]$$\n\nwhere, as before, do and di are object distance and image distance, respectively. Remember, this equation is usually more useful if rearranged to solve for one of the variables. For example,\n\n$$\\[d_{i} = \\frac{fd_{o}}{d_{o} - f}.\\]$$\n\nThe equations for magnification, m, are also the same as for mirrors\n\n$$\\[m = \\frac{h_{i}}{h_{o}} = - \\frac{d_{i}}{d_{o}},\\]$$\n\nwhere hi and ho are the image height and object height, respectively. Remember, also, that a negative di value indicates a virtual image and a negative hi value indicates an inverted image.\n\nThese are the steps to follow when solving a lens problem:\n\nStep 1. Examine the situation to determine that image formation by a lens is involved. Step 2. Determine whether ray tracing, the thin-lens equations, or both should be used. A sketch is very helpful even if ray tracing is not specifically required by the problem. Write useful symbols and values on the sketch. Step 3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). Step 4. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). It is helpful to determine whether the situation involves a case 1, 2, or 3 image. Although these are just names for types of images, they have certain characteristics (given in Table 16.3) that can be of great use in solving problems. Step 5. If ray tracing is required, use the ray-tracing rules listed earlier in this section. Step 6. Most quantitative problems require the use of the thin-lens equations. These equations are solved in the usual manner by substituting knowns and solving for unknowns. Several worked examples were included earlier and can serve as guides. Step 7. Check whether the answer is reasonable. Does it make sense? If you identified the type of image (case 1, 2, or 3) correctly, you should assess whether your answer is consistent with the type of image, magnification, and so on. \n\nAll problems will be solved by one or more of the equations just presented, with ray tracing used only for general analysis of the problem. The steps then simplify to the following:\n\nIdentify the unknown. Identify the knowns. Choose an equation, plug in the knowns, and solve for the unknown. \n\nHere are some worked examples:",

                    "context": "We know that visible light is the type of electromagnetic wave to which our eyes responds. As we have seen previously, light obeys the equation\n\n$$\\[c = f\\lambda,\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(c = 3.00\\  \\times \\ 10^{8}\\)$$  m/s is the speed of light in vacuum, f is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave in Hz (or s\u20131), and  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$  is its wavelength in m. The range of visible wavelengths is approximately 380 to 750 nm. As is true for all waves, light travels in straight lines and acts like a ray when it interacts with objects several times as large as its wavelength. However, when it interacts with smaller objects, it displays its wave characteristics prominently. Interference is the identifying behavior of a wave.\n\nIn Figure 17.2, both the ray and wave characteristics of light can be seen. The laser beam emitted by the observatory represents ray behavior, as it travels in a straight line. Passing a pure, one-wavelength beam through vertical slits with a width close to the wavelength of the beam reveals the wave character of light. Here we see the beam spreading out horizontally into a pattern of bright and dark regions that are caused by systematic constructive and destructive interference. As it is characteristic of wave behavior, interference is observed for water waves, sound waves, and light waves.\n\nThat interference is a characteristic of energy propagation by waves is demonstrated more convincingly by water waves. Figure 17.3 shows water waves passing through gaps between some rocks. You can easily see that the gaps are similar in width to the wavelength of the waves and that this causes an interference pattern as the waves pass beyond the gaps. A cross-section across the waves in the foreground would show the crests and troughs characteristic of an interference pattern.\n\nLight has wave characteristics in various media as well as in a vacuum. When light goes from a vacuum to some medium, such as water, its speed and wavelength change, but its frequency, f, remains the same. The speed of light in a medium is  $$\\(v = c/n\\)$$, where n is its index of refraction. If you divide both sides of the equation  $$\\(c = f\\lambda\\)$$  by n, you get  $$\\(c/n = v = f\\lambda/n\\)$$ . Therefore,  $$\\(v = f\\lambda_{n}\\)$$, where  $$\\(\\lambda_{n}\\)$$  is the wavelength in a medium, and \n\n$$\\[\\lambda_{n} = \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$  is the wavelength in vacuum and n is the medium\u2019s index of refraction. It follows that the wavelength of light is smaller in any medium than it is in vacuum. In water, for example, which has n = 1.333, the range of visible wavelengths is (380 nm)/1.333 to (760 nm)/1.333, or  $$\\(\\lambda_{n} =\\)$$ 285\u2013570 nm. Although wavelengths change while traveling from one medium to another, colors do not, since colors are associated with frequency.\n\nThe Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629\u20131695) developed a useful technique for determining in detail how and where waves propagate. He used wavefronts, which are the points on a wave\u2019s surface that share the same, constant phase (such as all the points that make up the crest of a water wave). Huygens\u2019s principle states, \u201cEvery point on a wavefront is a source of wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself. The new wavefront is a line tangent to all of the wavelets.\u201d\n\nFigure 17.4 shows how Huygens\u2019s principle is applied. A wavefront is the long edge that moves; for example, the crest or the trough. Each point on the wavefront emits a semicircular wave that moves at the propagation speed v. These are drawn later at a time, t, so that they have moved a distance  $$\\(s = vt\\)$$ . The new wavefront is a line tangent to the wavelets and is where the wave is located at time t. Huygens\u2019s principle works for all types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, and light waves. It will be useful not only in describing how light waves propagate, but also in how they interfere.\n\nWhat happens when a wave passes through an opening, such as light shining through an open door into a dark room? For light, you expect to see a sharp shadow of the doorway on the floor of the room, and you expect no light to bend around corners into other parts of the room. When sound passes through a door, you hear it everywhere in the room and, thus, you understand that sound spreads out when passing through such an opening. What is the difference between the behavior of sound waves and light waves in this case? The answer is that the wavelengths that make up the light are very short, so that the light acts like a ray. Sound has wavelengths on the order of the size of the door, and so it bends around corners.\n\nIf light passes through smaller openings, often called slits, you can use Huygens\u2019s principle to show that light bends as sound does (see Figure 17.5). The bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle is called diffraction. Diffraction is a wave characteristic that occurs for all types of waves. If diffraction is observed for a phenomenon, it is evidence that the phenomenon is produced by waves. Thus, the horizontal diffraction of the laser beam after it passes through slits in Figure 17.2 is evidence that light has the properties of a wave.\n\nOnce again, water waves present a familiar example of a wave phenomenon that is easy to observe and understand, as shown in Figure 17.6.\n\nThe fact that Huygens\u2019s principle worked was not considered enough evidence to prove that light is a wave. People were also reluctant to accept light\u2019s wave nature because it contradicted the ideas of Isaac Newton, who was still held in high esteem. The acceptance of the wave character of light came after 1801, when the English physicist and physician Thomas Young (1773\u20131829) did his now-classic double-slit experiment (see Figure 17.7).\n\nWhen light passes through narrow slits, it is diffracted into semicircular waves, as shown in Figure 17.8 (a). Pure constructive interference occurs where the waves line up crest to crest or trough to trough. Pure destructive interference occurs where they line up crest to trough. The light must fall on a screen and be scattered into our eyes for the pattern to be visible. An analogous pattern for water waves is shown in Figure 17.8 (b). Note that regions of constructive and destructive interference move out from the slits at well-defined angles to the original beam. Those angles depend on wavelength and the distance between the slits, as you will see below.",

                    "context": "The fact that the wavelength of light of one color, or monochromatic light, can be calculated from its two-slit diffraction pattern in Young\u2019s experiments supports the conclusion that light has wave properties. To understand the basis of such calculations, consider how two waves travel from the slits to the screen. Each slit is a different distance from a given point on the screen. Thus different numbers of wavelengths fit into each path. Waves start out from the slits in phase (crest to crest), but they will end up out of phase (crest to trough) at the screen if the paths differ in length by half a wavelength, interfering destructively. If the paths differ by a whole wavelength, then the waves arrive in phase (crest to crest) at the screen, interfering constructively. More generally, if the paths taken by the two waves differ by any half-integral number of wavelengths  $$\\((\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda,\\ \\frac{3}{2}\\lambda,\\ \\frac{5}{2}\\lambda,\\text{~etc}\\text{.)}\\)$$, then destructive interference occurs. Similarly, if the paths taken by the two waves differ by any integral number of wavelengths  $$\\((\\lambda,\\ 2\\lambda,\\ 3\\lambda,\\text{~etc}\\text{.)}\\)$$, then constructive interference occurs.\n\nFigure 17.9 shows how to determine the path-length difference for waves traveling from two slits to a common point on a screen. If the screen is a large distance away compared with the distance between the slits, then the angle  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  between the path and a line from the slits perpendicular to the screen (see the figure) is nearly the same for each path. That approximation and simple trigonometry show the length difference,  $$\\(\\Delta L\\)$$, to be  $$\\(d\\sin\\theta\\)$$, where d is the distance between the slits,\n\n$$\\[\\Delta L = d\\sin\\theta\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nTo obtain constructive interference for a double slit, the path-length difference must be an integral multiple of the wavelength, or\n\n$$\\[d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda,\\text{~for~}m = 0,1, - 1,2, - 2,\\ldots\\text{(constructive).}\\]$$\n\nSimilarly, to obtain destructive interference for a double slit, the path-length difference must be a half-integral multiple of the wavelength, or\n\n$$\\[d\\sin\\theta = (m + \u00bd)\\lambda,\\text{~for~}m = 0,1, - 1,2, - 2,\\ldots\\text{(destructive).}\\]$$\n\nThe number m is the order of the interference. For example, m = 4 is fourth-order interference.\n\nFigure 17.10 shows how the intensity of the bands of constructive interference decreases with increasing angle.\n\nLight passing through a single slit forms a diffraction pattern somewhat different from that formed by double slits. Figure 17.11 shows a single-slit diffraction pattern. Note that the central maximum is larger than those on either side, and that the intensity decreases rapidly on either side.\n\nThe analysis of single-slit diffraction is illustrated in Figure 17.12. Assuming the screen is very far away compared with the size of the slit, rays heading toward a common destination are nearly parallel. That approximation allows a series of trigonometric operations that result in the equations for the minima produced by destructive interference.\n\n$$\\[D\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda\\]$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\[\\frac{Dy}{L} = m\\lambda\\]$$\n\nWhen rays travel straight ahead, they remain in phase and a central maximum is obtained. However, when rays travel at an angle  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  relative to the original direction of the beam, each ray travels a different distance to the screen, and they can arrive in or out of phase. Thus, a ray from the center travels a distance  $$\\(\\lambda/2\\)$$  farther than the ray from the top edge of the slit, they arrive out of phase, and they interfere destructively. Similarly, for every ray between the top and the center of the slit, there is a ray between the center and the bottom of the slit that travels a distance  $$\\(\\lambda/2\\)$$  farther to the common point on the screen, and so interferes destructively. Symmetrically, there will be another minimum at the same angle below the direct ray.\n\nBelow we summarize the equations needed for the calculations to follow.\n\nThe speed of light in a vacuum, c, the wavelength of the light,  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$, and its frequency, f, are related as follows.\n\n$$\\[c = f\\lambda\\]$$\n\nThe wavelength of light in a medium,  $$\\(\\lambda_{n}\\)$$, compared to its wavelength in a vacuum,  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$, is given by\n\n$$\\[\\lambda_{n} = \\frac{\\lambda}{n}.\\]$$\n\nTo calculate the positions of constructive interference for a double slit, the path-length difference must be an integral multiple, m, of the wavelength.  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$ \n\n$$\\[d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda,\\text{~for~}m = 0,1, - 1,2, - 2,\\ldots\\text{(constructive),}\\]$$\n\nwhere d is the distance between the slits and  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  is the angle between a line from the slits to the maximum and a line perpendicular to the barrier in which the slits are located. To calculate the positions of destructive interference for a double slit, the path-length difference must be a half-integral multiple of the wavelength:\n\n$$\\[d\\sin\\theta = (m + \u00bd)\\lambda,\\text{~for~}m = 0,1, - 1,2, - 2,\\ldots\\text{(destructive).}\\]$$\n\nFor a single-slit diffraction pattern, the width of the slit, D, the distance of the first (m = 1) destructive interference minimum, y, the distance from the slit to the screen, L, and the wavelength,  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$, are given by\n\n$$\\[\\frac{Dy}{L} = \\lambda\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nAlso, for single-slit diffraction,\n\n$$\\[D\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  is the angle between a line from the slit to the minimum and a line perpendicular to the screen, and m is the order of the minimum.",

                    "context": "In 1917, Albert Einstein was thinking about photons and excited atoms. He considered an atom excited by a certain amount of energy and what would happen if that atom were hit by a photon with the same amount of energy. He suggested that the atom would emit a photon with that amount of energy, and it would be accompanied by the original photon. The exciting part is that you would have two photons with the same energy and they would be in phase. Those photons could go on to hit other excited atoms, and soon you would have a stream of in-phase photons. Such a light stream is said to be coherent. Some four decades later, Einstein\u2019s idea found application in a process called, light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Take the first letters of all the words (except by and \u201cof\u201d) and write them in order. You get the word laser (see Figure 17.2 (a)), which is the name of the device that produces such a beam of light.\n\nLaser beams are directional, very intense, and narrow (only about 0.5 mm in diameter). These properties lead to a number of applications in industry and medicine. The following are just a few examples:\n\nThis chapter began with a picture of a compact disc (see Figure 17.1). Those audio and data-storage devices began replacing cassette tapes during the 1990s. CDs are read by interpreting variations in reflections of a laser beam from the surface. Some barcode scanners use a laser beam. Lasers are used in industry to cut steel and other metals. Lasers are bounced off reflectors that astronauts left on the Moon. The time it takes for the light to make the round trip can be used to make precise calculations of the Earth-Moon distance. Laser beams are used to produce holograms. The name hologram means entire picture (from the Greek holo-, as in holistic), because the image is three-dimensional. A viewer can move around the image and see it from different perspectives. Holograms take advantage of the wave properties of light, as opposed to traditional photography which is based on geometric optics. A holographic image is produced by constructive and destructive interference of a split laser beam. One of the advantages of using a laser as a surgical tool is that it is accompanied by very little bleeding. Laser eye surgery has improved the vision of many people, without the need for corrective lenses. A laser beam is used to change the shape of the lens of the eye, thus changing its focal length. \n\nAn interesting thing happens if you pass light through a large number of evenly-spaced parallel slits. Such an arrangement of slits is called a diffraction grating. An interference pattern is created that is very similar to the one formed by double-slit diffraction (see Figure 17.8 and Figure 17.9). A diffraction grating can be manufactured by scratching glass with a sharp tool to form a number of precisely positioned parallel lines, which act like slits. Diffraction gratings work both for transmission of light, as in Figure 17.13, and for reflection of light, as on the butterfly wings or the Australian opal shown in Figure 17.14, or the CD pictured in the opening illustration of this chapter. In addition to their use as novelty items, diffraction gratings are commonly used for spectroscopic dispersion and analysis of light. What makes them particularly useful is the fact that they form a sharper pattern than do double slits. That is, their bright regions are narrower and brighter, while their dark regions are darker. Figure 17.15 shows idealized graphs demonstrating the sharper pattern. Natural diffraction gratings occur in the feathers of certain birds. Tiny, fingerlike structures in regular patterns act as reflection gratings, producing constructive interference that gives the feathers colors not solely due to their pigmentation. The effect is called iridescence.\n\nWhere are diffraction gratings used? Diffraction gratings are key components of monochromators\u2014devices that separate the various wavelengths of incoming light and allow a beam with only a specific wavelength to pass through. Monochromators are used, for example, in optical imaging of particular wavelengths from biological or medical samples. A diffraction grating can be chosen to specifically analyze a wavelength of light emitted by molecules in diseased cells in a biopsy sample, or to help excite strategic molecules in the sample with a selected frequency of light. Another important use is in optical fiber technologies where fibers are designed to provide optimum performance at specific wavelengths. A range of diffraction gratings is available for selecting specific wavelengths for such use.\n\nDiffraction gratings are used in spectroscopes to separate a light source into its component wavelengths. When a material is heated to incandescence, it gives off wavelengths of light characteristic of the chemical makeup of the material. A pure substance will produce a spectrum that is unique, thus allowing identification of the substance. Spectroscopes are also used to measure wavelengths both shorter and longer than visible light. Such instruments have become especially useful to astronomers and chemists. Figure 17.18 shows a diagram of a spectroscope.\n\nLight diffracts as it moves through space, bending around obstacles and interfering constructively and destructively. While diffraction allows light to be used as a spectroscopic tool, it also limits the detail we can obtain in images.\n\n\n\nFigure 17.19 (a) shows the effect of passing light through a small circular aperture. Instead of a bright spot with sharp edges, a spot with a fuzzy edge surrounded by circles of light is obtained. This pattern is caused by diffraction similar to that produced by a single slit. Light from different parts of the circular aperture interferes constructively and destructively. The effect is most noticeable when the aperture is small, but the effect is there for large apertures, too.\n\nHow does diffraction affect the detail that can be observed when light passes through an aperture? Figure 17.19 (b) shows the diffraction pattern produced by two point light sources that are close to one another. The pattern is similar to that for a single point source, and it is just barely possible to tell that there are two light sources rather than one. If they are closer together, as in Figure 17.19 (c), you cannot distinguish them, thus limiting the detail, or resolution, you can obtain. That limit is an inescapable consequence of the wave nature of light.\n\nThere are many situations in which diffraction limits the resolution. The acuity of vision is limited because light passes through the pupil, the circular aperture of the eye. Be aware that the diffraction-like spreading of light is due to the limited diameter of a light beam, not the interaction with an aperture. Thus light passing through a lens with a diameter of D shows the diffraction effect and spreads, blurring the image, just as light passing through an aperture of diameter D does. Diffraction limits the resolution of any system having a lens or mirror. Telescopes are also limited by diffraction, because of the finite diameter, D, of their primary mirror.",

                    "context": "Early in the chapter, it was mentioned that when light passes from one medium to another, its speed and wavelength change, but its frequency remains constant. The equation\n\n$$\\[\\lambda_{n} = \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\]$$\n\nshows how to the wavelength in a given medium,  $$\\(\\lambda_{n}\\)$$, is related to the wavelength in a vacuum,  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$, and the refractive index, n, of the medium. The equation is useful for calculating the change in wavelength of a monochromatic laser beam in various media. The analysis of a diffraction grating is very similar to that for a double slit. As you know from the discussion of double slits in Young\u2019s double-slit experiment, light is diffracted by, and spreads out after passing through, each slit. Rays travel at an angle  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  relative to the incident direction. Each ray travels a different distance to a common point on a screen far away. The rays start in phase, and they can be in or out of phase when they reach a screen, depending on the difference in the path lengths traveled. Each ray travels a distance that differs by  $$\\(d\\sin\\theta\\)$$  from that of its neighbor, where d is the distance between slits. If  $$\\(d\\sin\\theta\\)$$  equals an integral number of wavelengths, the rays all arrive in phase, and constructive interference (a maximum) is obtained. Thus, the condition necessary to obtain constructive interference for a diffraction grating is\n\n$$\\[d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda,\\text{for~}m = 0,1, - 1,2, - 2,\\ldots\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere d is the distance between slits in the grating,  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$  is the wavelength of the light, and m is the order of the maximum. Note that this is exactly the same equation as for two slits separated by d. However, the slits are usually closer in diffraction gratings than in double slits, producing fewer maxima at larger angles.\n\nJust what is the resolution limit of an aperture or lens? To answer that question, consider the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, which, similar to the diffraction pattern of light passing through a slit, has a central maximum that is wider and brighter than the maxima surrounding it (see Figure 17.19 (a)). It can be shown that, for a circular aperture of diameter D, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at  $$\\(\\theta = 1.22\\lambda/D\\)$$, provided that the aperture is large compared with the wavelength of light, which is the case for most optical instruments. The accepted criterion for determining the diffraction limit to resolution based on diffraction was developed by Lord Rayleigh in the 19th century. The Rayleigh criterion for the diffraction limit to resolution states that two images are just resolvable when the center of the diffraction pattern of one is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other. See Figure 17.20 (b). The first minimum is at an angle of  $$\\(\\theta = 1.22\\lambda/D\\)$$, so that two point objects are just resolvable if they are separated by the angle\n\n$$\\[\\theta = 1.22\\frac{\\lambda}{D},\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$  is the wavelength of the light (or other electromagnetic radiation) and D is the diameter of the aperture, lens, mirror, etc., with which the two objects are observed. In the expression above,  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  has units of radians.",

                    "context": "You may know someone who has an electric personality, which usually means that other people are attracted to this person. This saying is based on electric charge, which is a property of matter that causes objects to attract or repel each other. Electric charge comes in two varieties, which we call positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, and unlike charges attract each other. Thus, two positive charges repel each other, as do two negative charges. A positive charge and a negative charge attract each other.\n\nHow do we know there are two types of electric charge? When various materials are rubbed together in controlled ways, certain combinations of materials always result in a net charge of one type on one material and a net charge of the opposite type on the other material. By convention, we call one type of charge positive and the other type negative. For example, when glass is rubbed with silk, the glass becomes positively charged and the silk negatively charged. Because the glass and silk have opposite charges, they attract one another like clothes that have rubbed together in a dryer. Two glass rods rubbed with silk in this manner will repel one another, because each rod has positive charge on it. Similarly, two silk cloths rubbed in this manner will repel each other, because both cloths have negative charge. Figure 18.2 shows how these simple materials can be used to explore the nature of the force between charges.\n\nIt took scientists a long time to discover what lay behind these two types of charges. The word electric itself comes from the Greek word elektron for amber, because the ancient Greeks noticed that amber, when rubbed by fur, attracts dry straw. Almost 2,000 years later, the English physicist William Gilbert proposed a model that explained the effect of electric charge as being due to a mysterious electrical fluid that would pass from one object to another. This model was debated for several hundred years, but it was finally put to rest in 1897 by the work of the English physicist J. J. Thomson and French physicist Jean Perrin. Along with many others, Thomson and Perrin were studying the mysterious cathode rays that were known at the time to consist of particles smaller than the smallest atom. Perrin showed that cathode rays actually carried negative electrical charge. Later, Thomson\u2019s work led him to declare, \u201cI can see no escape from the conclusion that [cathode rays] are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of matter.\u201d\n\nIt took several years of further experiments to confirm Thomson\u2019s interpretation of the experiments, but science had in fact discovered the particle that carries the fundamental unit of negative electrical charge. We now know this particle as the electron.\n\nAtoms, however, were known to be electrically neutral, which means that they carry the same amount of positive and negative charge, so their net charge is zero. Because electrons are negative, some other part of the atom must contain positive charge. Thomson put forth what is called the plum pudding model, in which he described atoms as being made of thousands of electrons swimming around in a nebulous mass of positive charge, as shown by the left-side image of Figure 18.3. His student, Ernest Rutherford, originally believed that this model was correct and used it (along with other models) to try to understand the results of his experiments bombarding gold foils with alpha particles (i.e., helium atoms stripped of their electrons). The results, however, did not confirm Thomson\u2019s model but rather destroyed it! Rutherford found that most of the space occupied by the gold atoms was actually empty and that almost all of the matter of each atom was concentrated into a tiny, extremely dense nucleus, as shown by the right-side image of Figure 18.3. The atomic nucleus was later found to contain particles called protons, each of which carries a unit of positive electric charge.1\n\nProtons and electrons are thus the fundamental particles that carry electric charge. Each proton carries one unit of positive charge, and each electron carries one unit of negative charge. To the best precision that modern technology can provide, the charge carried by a proton is exactly the opposite of that carried by an electron. The SI unit for electric charge is the coulomb (abbreviated as \u201cC\u201d), which is named after the French physicist Charles Augustin de Coulomb, who studied the force between charged objects. The proton carries  $$\\(+ 1.602\\  \\times \\ 10^{-19}\\text{C.}\\)$$  and the electron carries  $$\\(-1.602\\  \\times \\ 10^{-19}\\text{C,}\\)$$ . The number n of protons required to make +1.00 C is\n\n$$\\[n = 1.00\\;\\text{C}\\  \\times \\ \\frac{1\\;\\text{proton}}{1.602\\  \\times \\ 10^{- 19}\\text{C}} = 6.25\\  \\times \\ 10^{18}\\text{protons.}\\]$$\n\nThe same number of electrons is required to make \u22121.00 C of electric charge. The fundamental unit of charge is often represented as e. Thus, the charge on a proton is e, and the charge on an electron is \u2212e. Mathematically,  $$\\(e = + 1.602\\  \\times \\ 10^{-19}\\text{C}\\text{.}\\)$$ ",

In other words, although we might be able to move charge around, we cannot create or destroy it. This should be true provided that we do not create or destroy protons or electrons in our system. In the twentieth century, however, scientists learned how to create and destroy electrons and protons, but they found that charge is still conserved. Many experiments and solid theoretical arguments have elevated this idea to the status of a law. The law of conservation of charge says that electrical charge cannot be created or destroyed.\n\nThe law of conservation of charge is very useful. It tells us that the net charge in a system is the same before and after any interaction within the system. Of course, we must ensure that no external charge enters the system during the interaction and that no internal charge leaves the system. Mathematically, conservation of charge can be expressed as\n\n$$\\[q_{initial} = q_{final}.\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(q_{\\text{initial}}\\)$$  is the net charge of the system before the interaction, and  $$\\(q_{\\text{final,}}\\)$$  is the net charge after the interaction.",

                    "context": "Materials can be classified depending on whether they allow charge to move. If charge can easily move through a material, such as metals, then these materials are called conductors. This means that charge can be conducted (i.e., move) through the material rather easily. If charge cannot move through a material, such as rubber, then this material is called an insulator.\n\nMost materials are insulators. Their atoms and molecules hold on more tightly to their electrons, so it is difficult for electrons to move between atoms. However, it is not impossible. With enough energy, it is possible to force electrons to move through an insulator. However, the insulator is often physically destroyed in the process. In metals, the outer electrons are loosely bound to their atoms, so not much energy is required to make electrons move through metal. Such metals as copper, silver, and aluminum are good conductors. Insulating materials include plastics, glass, ceramics, and wood.\n\nThe conductivity of some materials is intermediate between conductors and insulators. These are called semiconductors. They can be made conductive under the right conditions, which can involve temperature, the purity of the material, and the force applied to push electrons through them. Because we can control whether semiconductors are conductors or insulators, these materials are used extensively in computer chips. The most commonly used semiconductor is silicon. Figure 18.8 shows various materials arranged according to their ability to conduct electrons.\n\nWhat happens if an excess negative charge is placed on a conducting object? Because like charges repel each other, they will push against each other until they are as far apart as they can get. Because the charge can move in a conductor, it moves to the outer surfaces of the object. Figure 18.9(a) shows schematically how an excess negative charge spreads itself evenly over the outer surface of a metal sphere.\n\nWhat happens if the same is done with an insulating object? The electrons still repel each other, but they are not able to move, because the material is an insulator. Thus, the excess charge stays put and does not distribute itself over the object. Figure 18.9(b) shows this situation.",

                    "context": "Most objects we deal with are electrically neutral, which means that they have the same amount of positive and negative charge. However, transferring negative charge from one object to another is fairly easy to do. When negative charge is transferred from one object to another, an excess of positive charge is left behind. How do we know that the negative charge is the mobile charge? The positive charge is carried by the proton, which is stuck firmly in the nucleus of atoms, and the atoms are stuck in place in solid materials. Electrons, which carry the negative charge, are much easier to remove from their atoms or molecules and can therefore be transferred more easily.\n\nElectric charge can be transferred in several manners. One of the simplest ways to transfer charge is charging by contact, in which the surfaces of two objects made of different materials are placed in close contact. If one of the materials holds electrons more tightly than the other, then it takes some electrons with it when the materials are separated. Rubbing two surfaces together increases the transfer of electrons, because it creates a closer contact between the materials. It also serves to present fresh material with a full supply of electrons to the other material. Thus, when you walk across a carpet on a dry day, your shoes rub against the carpet, and some electrons are removed from the carpet by your shoes. The result is that you have an excess of negative charge on your shoes. When you then touch a doorknob, some of your excess of electrons transfer to the neutral doorknob, creating a small spark.\n\nTouching the doorknob with your hand demonstrates a second way to transfer electric charge, which is charging by conduction. This transfer happens because like charges repel, and so the excess electrons that you picked up from the carpet want to be as far away from each other as possible. Some of them move to the doorknob, where they will distribute themselves over the outer surface of the metal. Another example of charging by conduction is shown in the top row of Figure 18.10. A metal sphere with 100 excess electrons touches a metal sphere with 50 excess electrons, so 25 electrons from the first sphere transfer to the second sphere. Each sphere finishes with 75 excess electrons.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to the transfer of positive charge. However, because positive charge essentially cannot move in solids, it is transferred by moving negative charge in the opposite direction. For example, consider the bottom row of Figure 18.10. The first metal sphere has 100 excess protons and touches a metal sphere with 50 excess protons, so the second sphere transfers 25 electrons to the first sphere. These 25 extra electrons will electrically cancel 25 protons so that the first metal sphere is left with 75 excess protons. This is shown in the bottom row of Figure 18.10. The second metal sphere lost 25 electrons so it has 25 more excess protons, for a total of 75 excess protons. The end result is the same if we consider that the first ball transferred a net positive charge equal to that of 25 protons to the first ball.\n\nIn this discussion, you may wonder how the excess electrons originally got from your shoes to your hand to create the spark when you touched the doorknob. The answer is that no electrons actually traveled from your shoes to your hands. Instead, because like charges repel each other, the excess electrons on your shoe simply pushed away some of the electrons in your feet. The electrons thus dislodged from your feet moved up into your leg and in turn pushed away some electrons in your leg. This process continued through your whole body until a distribution of excess electrons covered the extremities of your body. Thus your head, your hands, the tip of your nose, and so forth all received their doses of excess electrons that had been pushed out of their normal positions. All this was the result of electrons being pushed out of your feet by the excess electrons on your shoes.\n\nThis type of charge separation is called polarization. As soon as the excess electrons leave your shoes (by rubbing off onto the floor or being carried away in humid air), the distribution of electrons in your body returns to normal. Every part of your body is again electrically neutral (i.e., zero excess charge).\n\nThe phenomenon of polarization is seen in Figure 18.1. The child has accumulated excess positive charge by sliding on the slide. This excess charge repels itself and so becomes distributed over the extremities of the child\u2019s body, notably in his hair. As a result, the hair stands on end, because the excess negative charge on each strand repels the excess positive charge on neighboring strands.\n\nPolarization can be used to charge objects. Consider the two metallic spheres shown in Figure 18.11. The spheres are electrically neutral, so they carry the same amounts of positive and negative charge. In the top picture (Figure 18.11(a)), the two spheres are touching, and the positive and negative charge is evenly distributed over the two spheres. We then approach a glass rod that carries an excess positive charge, which can be done by rubbing the glass rod with silk, as shown in Figure 18.11(b). Because opposite charges attract each other, the negative charge is attracted to the glass rod, leaving an excess positive charge on the opposite side of the right sphere. This is an example of charging by induction, whereby a charge is created by approaching a charged object with a second object to create an unbalanced charge in the second object. If we then separate the two spheres, as shown in Figure 18.11(c), the excess charge is stuck on each sphere. The left sphere now has an excess negative charge, and the right sphere has an excess positive charge. Finally, in the bottom picture, the rod is removed, and the opposite charges attract each other, so they move as close together as they can get.",

                    "context": "More than 100 years before Thomson and Rutherford discovered the fundamental particles that carry positive and negative electric charges, the French scientist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb mathematically described the force between charged objects. Doing so required careful measurements of forces between charged spheres, for which he built an ingenious device called a torsion balance.\n\nThis device, shown in Figure 18.15, contains an insulating rod that is hanging by a thread inside a glass-walled enclosure. At one end of the rod is the metallic sphere A. When no charge is on this sphere, it touches sphere B. Coulomb would touch the spheres with a third metallic ball (shown at the bottom of the diagram) that was charged. An unknown amount of charge would distribute evenly between spheres A and B, which would then repel each other, because like charges repel. This force would cause sphere A to rotate away from sphere B, thus twisting the wire until the torsion in the wire balanced the electrical force. Coulomb then turned the knob at the top, which allowed him to rotate the thread, thus bringing sphere A closer to sphere B. He found that bringing sphere A twice as close to sphere B required increasing the torsion by a factor of four. Bringing the sphere three times closer required a ninefold increase in the torsion. From this type of measurement, he deduced that the electrical force between the spheres was inversely proportional to the distance squared between the spheres. In other words,\n\n$$\\[F \\propto \\frac{1}{r^{2,}}\\]$$\n\nwhere r is the distance between the spheres.\n\nAn electrical charge distributes itself equally between two conducting spheres of the same size. Knowing this allowed Coulomb to divide an unknown charge in half. Repeating this process would produce a sphere with one quarter of the initial charge, and so on. Using this technique, he measured the force between spheres A and B when they were charged with different amounts of charge. These measurements led him to deduce that the force was proportional to the charge on each sphere, or\n\n$$\\[F \\propto q_{\\text{A}}q_{\\text{B,}}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(q_{\\text{A}}\\)$$  is the charge on sphere A, and  $$\\(q_{\\text{B}}\\)$$  is the charge on sphere B.\n\nCombining these two proportionalities, he proposed the following expression to describe the force between the charged spheres.\n\n$$\\[F = \\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}\\]$$\n\nThis equation is known as Coulomb\u2019s law, and it describes the electrostatic force between charged objects. The constant of proportionality k is called Coulomb\u2019s constant. In SI units, the constant k has the value  $$\\(k = 8.99\\  \\times \\ 10^{9}\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^{\\text{2}}\\text{/C}^{\\text{2.}}\\)$$ \n\nThe direction of the force is along the line joining the centers of the two objects. If the two charges are of opposite signs, Coulomb\u2019s law gives a negative result. This means that the force between the particles is attractive. If the two charges have the same signs, Coulomb\u2019s law gives a positive result. This means that the force between the particles is repulsive. For example, if both  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$  and  $$\\(q_{2}\\)$$  are negative or if both are positive, the force between them is repulsive. This is shown in Figure 18.16(a). If  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$  is a negative charge and  $$\\(q_{2}\\)$$  is a positive charge (or vice versa), then the charges are different, so the force between them is attractive. This is shown in Figure 18.16(b).\n\nNote that Coulomb\u2019s law applies only to charged objects that are not moving with respect to each other. The law says that the force is proportional to the amount of charge on each object and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. If we double the charge  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$, for instance, then the force is doubled. If we double the distance between the objects, then the force between them decreases by a factor of  $$\\(2^{2} = 4\\)$$ . Although Coulomb\u2019s law is true in general, it is easiest to apply to spherical objects or to objects that are much smaller than the distance between the objects (in which case, the objects can be approximated as spheres).\n\nCoulomb\u2019s law is an example of an inverse-square law, which means the force depends on the square of the denominator. Another inverse-square law is Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation, which is  $$\\(F = {{Gm_{1}m_{2}}/r^{2}}\\)$$ . Although these laws are similar, they differ in two important respects: (i) The gravitational constant G is much, much smaller than k ( $$\\(G = 6.67\\  \\times \\ 10^{- 11}\\text{m}^{3}\\text{/kg} \\cdot \\text{s}^{2}\\)$$ ); and (ii) only one type of mass exists, whereas two types of electric charge exist. These two differences explain why gravity is so much weaker than the electrostatic force and why gravity is only attractive, whereas the electrostatic force can be attractive or repulsive.\n\nFinally, note that Coulomb measured the distance between the spheres from the centers of each sphere. He did not explain this assumption in his original papers, but it turns out to be valid. From outside a uniform spherical distribution of charge, it can be treated as if all the charge were located at the center of the sphere.",

                    "context": "You may have heard of a force field in science fiction movies, where such fields apply forces at particular positions in space to keep a villain trapped or to protect a spaceship from enemy fire. The concept of a field is very useful in physics, although it differs somewhat from what you see in movies.\n\nA field is a way of conceptualizing and mapping the force that surrounds any object and acts on another object at a distance without apparent physical connection. For example, the gravitational field surrounding Earth and all other masses represents the gravitational force that would be experienced if another mass were placed at a given point within the field. Michael Faraday, an English physicist of the nineteenth century, proposed the concept of an electric field. If you know the electric field, then you can easily calculate the force (magnitude and direction) applied to any electric charge that you place in the field.\n\nAn electric field is generated by electric charge and tells us the force per unit charge at all locations in space around a charge distribution. The charge distribution could be a single point charge; a distribution of charge over, say, a flat plate; or a more complex distribution of charge. The electric field extends into space around the charge distribution. Now consider placing a test charge in the field. A test charge is a positive electric charge whose charge is so small that it does not significantly disturb the charges that create the electric field. The electric field exerts a force on the test charge in a given direction. The force exerted is proportional to the charge of the test charge. For example, if we double the charge of the test charge, the force exerted on it doubles. Mathematically, saying that electric field is the force per unit charge is written as\n\n$$\\[\\overset{\\rightarrow}{E} = \\frac{\\overset{\\rightarrow}{F}}{q_{\\text{test}}}\\]$$\n\nwhere we are considering only electric forces. Note that the electric field is a vector field that points in the same direction as the force on the positive test charge. The units of electric field are N/C.\n\nIf the electric field is created by a point charge or a sphere of uniform charge, then the magnitude of the force between this point charge Q and the test charge is given by Coulomb\u2019s law\n\n $$\\[F = \\frac{k\\left| {Qq_{\\text{test}}} \\right|}{r^{2}}\\]$$ \n\nwhere the absolute value is used, because we only consider the magnitude of the force. The magnitude of the electric field is then\n\n$$\\[E = \\frac{F}{q_{\\text{test}}} = \\frac{k|Q|}{r^{2}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis equation gives the magnitude of the electric field created by a point charge Q. The distance r in the denominator is the distance from the point charge, Q, or from the center of a spherical charge, to the point of interest.\n\nIf the test charge is removed from the electric field, the electric field still exists. To create a three-dimensional map of the electric field, imagine placing the test charge in various locations in the field. At each location, measure the force on the charge, and use the vector equation  $$\\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{E} = {\\overset{\\rightarrow}{F}/q_{\\text{test}}}\\)$$  to calculate the electric field. Draw an arrow at each point where you place the test charge to represent the strength and the direction of the electric field. The length of the arrows should be proportional to the strength of the electric field. If you join together these arrows, you obtain lines. Figure 18.17 shows an image of the three-dimensional electric field created by a positive charge.\n\nJust drawing the electric field lines in a plane that slices through the charge gives the two-dimensional electric-field maps shown in Figure 18.18. On the left is the electric field created by a positive charge, and on the right is the electric field created by a negative charge.\n\nNotice that the electric field lines point away from the positive charge and toward the negative charge. Thus, a positive test charge placed in the electric field of the positive charge will be repelled. This is consistent with Coulomb\u2019s law, which says that like charges repel each other. If we place the positive charge in the electric field of the negative charge, the positive charge is attracted to the negative charge. The opposite is true for negative test charges. Thus, the direction of the electric field lines is consistent with what we find by using Coulomb\u2019s law.\n\nThe equation  $$\\(E = {{k|Q|}/r^{2}}\\)$$  says that the electric field gets stronger as we approach the charge that generates it. For example, at 2 cm from the charge Q (r = 2 cm), the electric field is four times stronger than at 4 cm from the charge (r = 4 cm). Looking at Figure 18.17 and Figure 18.18 again, we see that the electric field lines become denser as we approach the charge that generates it. In fact, the density of the electric field lines is proportional to the strength of the electric field!\n\nElectric-field maps can be made for several charges or for more complicated charge distributions. The electric field due to multiple charges may be found by adding together the electric field from each individual charge. Because this sum can only be a single number, we know that only a single electric-field line can go through any given point. In other words, electric-field lines cannot cross each other.\n\nFigure 18.19(a) shows a two-dimensional map of the electric field generated by a charge of +q and a nearby charge of \u2212q. The three-dimensional version of this map is obtained by rotating this map about the axis that goes through both charges. A positive test charge placed in this field would experience a force in the direction of the field lines at its location. It would thus be repelled from the positive charge and attracted to the negative charge. Figure 18.19(b) shows the electric field generated by two charges of \u2212q. Note how the field lines tend to repel each other and do not overlap. A positive test charge placed in this field would be attracted to both charges. If you are far from these two charges, where far means much farther than the distance between the charges, the electric field looks like the electric field from a single charge of \u22122q.",

This kinetic energy can be used to do work. For example, imagine you want to use a stone to pound a nail into a piece of wood. You first lift the stone high above the nail, which increases the potential energy of the stone-Earth system\u2014because Earth is so large, it does not move, so we usually shorten this by saying simply that the potential energy of the stone increases. When you drop the stone, gravity converts the potential energy into kinetic energy. When the stone hits the nail, it does work by pounding the nail into the wood. The gravitational potential energy is the work that a mass can potentially do by virtue of its position in a gravitational field. Potential energy is a very useful concept, because it can be used with conservation of energy to calculate the motion of masses in a gravitational field.\n\nElectric potential energy works much the same way, but it is based on the electric field instead of the gravitational field. By virtue of its position in an electric field, a charge has an electric potential energy. If the charge is free to move, the force due to the electric field causes it to accelerate, so its potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, just like a mass that falls in a gravitational field. This kinetic energy can be used to do work. The electric potential energy is the work that a charge can do by virtue of its position in an electric field.\n\nThe analogy between gravitational potential energy and electric potential energy is depicted in Figure 18.21. On the left, the ball-Earth system gains gravitational potential energy when the ball is higher in Earth's gravitational field. On the right, the two-charge system gains electric potential energy when the positive charge is farther from the negative charge.\n\nLet\u2019s use the symbol  $$\\(U_{G}\\)$$  to denote gravitational potential energy. When a mass falls in a gravitational field, its gravitational potential energy decreases. Conservation of energy tells us that the work done by the gravitational field to make the mass accelerate must equal the loss of potential energy of the mass. If we use the symbol  $$\\(W_{\\text{done}\\text{by}\\text{gravity}}\\)$$  to denote this work, then\n\n$$\\[- \\Delta U_{\\text{G}} = W_{\\text{done}\\text{by}\\text{gravity,}}\\]$$\n\nwhere the minus sign reflects the fact that the potential energy of the ball decreases.\n\nThe work done by gravity on the mass is\n\n$$\\[W_{\\text{done}\\text{by}\\text{gravity}} = - F(y_{\\text{f}} - y_{\\text{i}}\\operatorname{),}\\]$$\n\nwhere F is the force due to gravity, and  $$\\(y_{\\text{i}}\\)$$  and  $$\\(y_{\\text{f}}\\)$$  are the initial and final positions of the ball, respectively. The negative sign is because gravity points down, which we consider to be the negative direction. For the constant gravitational field near Earth\u2019s surface,  $$\\(F = mg\\)$$ . The change in gravitational potential energy of the mass is\n\n$$\\[- \\Delta U_{\\text{G}} = W_{\\text{done}\\text{by}\\text{gravity}} = - F\\left( {y_{\\text{f}} - y_{\\text{i}}} \\right) = - mg\\left( {y_{\\text{f}} - y_{\\text{i}}} \\right)\\text{,\\ or}\\Delta U_{\\text{G}} = mg\\left( {y_{\\text{f}} - y_{\\text{i}}} \\right)\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nNote that  $$\\(y_{\\text{f}} - y_{\\text{i}}\\)$$  is just the negative of the height h from which the mass falls, so we usually just write  $$\\(\\Delta U_{\\text{G}} = - mgh\\)$$ .\n\nWe now apply the same reasoning to a charge in an electric field to find the electric potential energy. The change  $$\\(\\Delta U_{\\text{E}}\\)$$  in electric potential energy is the work done by the electric field to move a charge q from an initial position  $$\\(x_{\\text{i}}\\)$$  to a final position  $$\\(x_{\\text{f}}\\)$$  ( $$\\(- \\Delta U_{\\text{E}} = W_{\\text{done}\\text{by}\\text{E-field}}\\)$$ ). The definition of work does not change, except that now the work is done by the electric field:  $$\\(W_{\\text{done}\\text{by}\\text{E-field}} = F(x_{\\text{f}} - x_{\\text{i}})\\)$$ . For a charge that falls through a constant electric field E, the force applied to the charge by the electric field is  $$\\(F = qE\\)$$ . The change in electric potential energy of the charge is thus\n\n$$\\[- \\Delta U_{\\text{E}} = W_{\\text{done}\\text{by}\\text{E-field}} = Fd = qE\\left( {x_{\\text{f}} - x_{\\text{i}}} \\right)\\]$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\[\\Delta U_{\\text{E}} = - qE\\left( {x_{\\text{f}} - x_{\\text{i}}} \\right)\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis equation gives the change in electric potential energy of a charge q when it moves from position  $$\\(x_{\\text{i}}\\)$$  to position  $$\\(x_{\\text{f}}\\)$$  in a constant electric field E.\n\nFigure 18.22 shows how this analogy would work if we were close to Earth\u2019s surface, where gravity is constant. The top image shows a charge accelerating due to a constant electric field. Likewise, the round mass in the bottom image accelerates due to a constant gravitation field. In both cases, the potential energy of the particle decreases, and its kinetic energy increases.\n\nIf the electric field is not constant, then the equation  $$\\(\\Delta U_{\\text{E}} = - qE\\left( {x_{\\text{f}} - x_{\\text{i}}} \\right)\\)$$  is not valid, and deriving the electric potential energy becomes more involved. For example, consider the electric potential energy of an assembly of two point charges  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$  and  $$\\(q_{2}\\)$$  of the same sign that are initially very far apart. We start by placing charge  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$  at the origin of our coordinate system. This takes no electrical energy, because there is no electric field at the origin (because charge  $$\\(q_{2}\\)$$  is very far away). We then bring charge  $$\\(q_{2}\\)$$  in from very far away to a distance r from the center of charge  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$ . This requires some effort, because the electric field of charge  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$  applies a repulsive force on charge  $$\\(q_{2}\\)$$ . The energy it takes to assemble these two charges can be recuperated if we let them fly apart again. Thus, the charges have potential energy when they are a distance r apart. It turns out that the electric potential energy of a pair of point charges  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$  and  $$\\(q_{2}\\)$$  a distance r apart is\n\n$$\\[U_{\\text{E}} = \\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r}\\]$$\n\nTo recap, if charges  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$  and  $$\\(q_{2}\\)$$  are free to move, they can accumulate kinetic energy by flying apart, and this kinetic energy can be used to do work. The maximum amount of work the two charges can do (if they fly infinitely far from each other) is given by the equation above.\n\nNotice that if the two charges have opposite signs, then the potential energy is negative. This means that the charges have more potential to do work when they are far apart than when they are at a distance r apart. This makes sense: Opposite charges attract, so the charges can gain more kinetic energy if they attract each other from far away than if they start at only a short distance apart. Thus, they have more potential to do work when they are far apart. Figure 18.23 summarizes how the electric potential energy depends on charge and separation.",

                    "context": "Recall that to find the force applied by a fixed charge Q on any arbitrary test charge q, it was convenient to define the electric field, which is the force per unit charge applied by Q on any test charge that we place in its electric field. The same Strategy is used here with electric potential energy: We now define the electric potential V, which is the electric potential energy per unit charge.\n\n$$\\[V = \\frac{U_{\\text{E}}}{q}\\]$$\n\nNormally, the electric potential is simply called the potential or voltage. The units for the potential are J/C, which are given the name volt (V) after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745\u20131827). From the equation  $$\\(U_{\\text{E}} = {{kq_{1}q_{2}}/r}\\)$$, the electric potential a distance r from a point charge  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$  is\n\n$$\\[V = \\frac{U_{\\text{E}}}{q_{2}} = \\frac{kq_{1}}{r}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis equation gives the energy required per unit charge to bring a charge  $$\\(q_{2}\\)$$  from infinity to a distance r from a point charge  $$\\(q_{1}\\text{.}\\)$$  Mathematically, this is written as\n\n$$\\[V = \\left. \\frac{U_{E}}{q_{2}} \\right|_{R = r} - \\left. \\frac{U_{E}}{q_{2}} \\right|_{R = \\infty}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nNote that this equation actually represents a difference in electric potential. However, because the second term is zero, it is normally not written, and we speak of the electric potential instead of the electric potential difference, or we just say the potential difference, or voltage). Below, when we consider the electric potential energy per unit charge between two points not infinitely far apart, we speak of electric potential difference explicitly. Just remember that electric potential and electric potential difference are really the same thing; the former is used just when the electric potential energy is zero in either the initial or final charge configuration.\n\nComing back now to the electric potential a distance r from a point charge  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$, note that  $$\\(q_{1}\\)$$  can be any arbitrary point charge, so we can drop the subscripts and simply write\n\n$$\\[V = \\frac{kq}{r}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nNow consider the electric potential near a group of charges q1, q2, and q3, as drawn in Figure 18.24. The electric potential is derived by considering the electric field. Electric fields follow the principle of superposition and can be simply added together, so the electric potential from different charges also add together. Thus, the electric potential of a point near a group of charges is\n\n$$\\[V = \\frac{kq_{1}}{r_{1}} + \\frac{kq_{2}}{r_{2}} + \\frac{kq_{3}}{r_{3}} + \\operatorname{\\cdots.}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},\\operatorname{\\ldots,}\\)$$  are the distances from the center of charges  $$\\(q_{1},q_{2},q_{3},\\ldots\\)$$  to the point of interest, as shown in Figure 18.24.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the electric potential in a uniform electric field. From the equation  $$\\(\\Delta U_{\\text{E}} = - qE\\left( {x_{\\text{f}} - x_{\\text{i}}} \\right)\\)$$, we see that the potential difference in going from  $$\\(x_{\\text{i}}\\)$$  to  $$\\(x_{\\text{f}}\\)$$  in a uniform electric field E is\n\n$$\\[{\\Delta V = \\frac{\\Delta U_{E}}{q} = - E\\left( {x_{\\text{f}} - x_{\\text{i}}} \\right)}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nNotice that a positive charge in a region with high potential will experience a force pushing it toward regions of lower potential. In this sense, potential is like pressure for fluids. Imagine a pipe containing fluid, with the fluid at one end of the pipe under high pressure and the fluid at the other end of the pipe under low pressure. If nothing prevents the fluid from flowing, it will flow from the high-pressure end to the low-pressure end. Likewise, a positive charge that is free to move will move from a region with high potential to a region with lower potential.",

                    "context": "Consider again the X-ray tube discussed in the previous sample problem. How can a uniform electric field be produced? A single positive charge produces an electric field that points away from it, as in Figure 18.17. This field is not uniform, because the space between the lines increases as you move away from the charge. However, if we combine a positive and a negative charge, we obtain the electric field shown in Figure 18.19(a). Notice that, between the charges, the electric field lines are more equally spaced.\n\nWhat happens if we place, say, five positive charges in a line across from five negative charges, as in Figure 18.27? Now the region between the lines of charge contains a fairly uniform electric field.\n\nWe can extend this idea even further and into two dimensions by placing two metallic plates face to face and charging one with positive charge and the other with an equal magnitude of negative charge. This can be done by connecting one plate to the positive terminal of a battery and the other plate to the negative terminal, as shown in Figure 18.28. The electric field between these charged plates will be extremely uniform.\n\nLet\u2019s think about the work required to charge these plates. Before the plates are connected to the battery, they are neutral\u2014that is, they have zero net charge. Placing the first positive charge on the left plate and the first negative charge on the right plate requires very little work, because the plates are neutral, so no opposing charges are present. Now consider placing a second positive charge on the left plate and a second negative charge on the right plate. Because the first two charges repel the new arrivals, a force must be applied to the two new charges over a distance to put them on the plates. This is the definition of work, which means that, compared with the first pair, more work is required to put the second pair of charges on the plates. To place the third positive and negative charges on the plates requires yet more work, and so on. Where does this work come from? The battery! Its chemical potential energy is converted into the work required to separate the positive and negative charges.\n\nAlthough the battery does work, this work remains within the battery-plate system. Therefore, conservation of energy tells us that, if the potential energy of the battery decreases to separate charges, the energy of another part of the system must increase by the same amount. In fact, the energy from the battery is stored in the electric field between the plates. This idea is analogous to considering that the potential energy of a raised hammer is stored in Earth\u2019s gravitational field. If the gravitational field were to disappear, the hammer would have no potential energy. Likewise, if no electric field existed between the plates, no energy would be stored between them.\n\nIf we now disconnect the plates from the battery, they will hold the energy. We could connect the plates to a lightbulb, for example, and the lightbulb would light up until this energy was used up. These plates thus have the capacity to store energy. For this reason, an arrangement such as this is called a capacitor. A capacitor is an arrangement of objects that, by virtue of their geometry, can store energy an electric field.\n\nVarious real capacitors are shown in Figure 18.29. They are usually made from conducting plates or sheets that are separated by an insulating material. They can be flat or rolled up or have other geometries.\n\nThe capacity of a capacitor is defined by its capacitance C, which is given by\n\n$$\\[C = \\frac{Q}{V}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere Q is the magnitude of the charge on each capacitor plate, and V is the potential difference in going from the negative plate to the positive plate. This means that both Q and V are always positive, so the capacitance is always positive. We can see from the equation for capacitance that the units of capacitance are C/V, which are called farads (F) after the nineteenth-century English physicist Michael Faraday.\n\nThe equation  $$\\(C = {Q/V}\\)$$  makes sense: A parallel-plate capacitor (like the one shown in Figure 18.28) the size of a football field could hold a lot of charge without requiring too much work per unit charge to push the charge into the capacitor. Thus, Q would be large, and V would be small, so the capacitance C would be very large. Squeezing the same charge into a capacitor the size of a fingernail would require much more work, so V would be very large, and the capacitance would be much smaller.\n\nAlthough the equation  $$\\(C = {Q/V}\\)$$  makes it seem that capacitance depends on voltage, in fact it does not. For a given capacitor, the ratio of the charge stored in the capacitor to the voltage difference between the plates of the capacitor always remains the same. Capacitance is determined by the geometry of the capacitor and the materials that it is made from. For a parallel-plate capacitor with nothing between its plates, the capacitance is given by\n\n$$\\[C_{0} = \\varepsilon_{0}\\frac{A}{d}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere A is the area of the plates of the capacitor and d is their separation. We use  $$\\(C_{0}\\)$$  instead of C, because the capacitor has nothing between its plates (in the next section, we\u2019ll see what happens when this is not the case). The constant  $$\\(\\varepsilon_{0}\\text{,}\\)$$  read epsilon zero is called the permittivity of free space, and its value is\n\n$$\\[\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.85 \\times 10^{-12}\\text{~F/m}\\]$$\n\nComing back to the energy stored in a capacitor, we can ask exactly how much energy a capacitor stores. If a capacitor is charged by putting a voltage V across it for example, by connecting it to a battery with voltage V\u2014the electrical potential energy stored in the capacitor is\n\n$$\\[U_{E} = \\frac{1}{2}CV^{2}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nNotice that the form of this equation is similar to that for kinetic energy,  $$\\(K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^{2^{}}\\)$$ .",

                    "context": "Before working through some sample problems, let\u2019s look at what happens if we put an insulating material between the plates of a capacitor that has been charged and then disconnected from the charging battery, as illustrated in Figure 18.30. Because the material is insulating, the charge cannot move through it from one plate to the other, so the charge Q on the capacitor does not change. An electric field exists between the plates of a charged capacitor, so the insulating material becomes polarized, as shown in the lower part of the figure. An electrically insulating material that becomes polarized in an electric field is called a dielectric.\n\nFigure 18.30 shows that the negative charge in the molecules in the material shifts to the left, toward the positive charge of the capacitor. This shift is due to the electric field, which applies a force to the left on the electrons in the molecules of the dielectric. The right sides of the molecules are now missing a bit of negative charge, so their net charge is positive.\n\nAll electrically insulating materials are dielectrics, but some are better dielectrics than others. A good dielectric is one whose molecules allow their electrons to shift strongly in an electric field. In other words, an electric field pulls their electrons a fair bit away from their atom, but they do not escape completely from their atom (which is why they are insulators).\n\nFigure 18.31 shows a macroscopic view of a dielectric in a charged capacitor. Notice that the electric-field lines in the capacitor with the dielectric are spaced farther apart than the electric-field lines in the capacitor with no dielectric. This means that the electric field in the dielectric is weaker, so it stores less electrical potential energy than the electric field in the capacitor with no dielectric.\n\nWhere has this energy gone? In fact, the molecules in the dielectric act like tiny springs, and the energy in the electric field goes into stretching these springs. With the electric field thus weakened, the voltage difference between the two sides of the capacitor is smaller, so it becomes easier to put more charge on the capacitor. Placing a dielectric in a capacitor before charging it therefore allows more charge and potential energy to be stored in the capacitor. A parallel plate with a dielectric has a capacitance of\n\n$$\\[C = \\kappa\\varepsilon_{0}\\frac{A}{d} = \\kappa C_{0}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(\\kappa\\)$$  (kappa) is a dimensionless constant called the dielectric constant. Because  $$\\(\\kappa\\)$$  is greater than 1 for dielectrics, the capacitance increases when a dielectric is placed between the capacitor plates. The dielectric constant of several materials is shown in Table 18.1.",

                    "context": "Just as water flows from high to low elevation, electrons that are free to move will travel from a place with low potential to a place with high potential. A battery has two terminals that are at different potentials. If the terminals are connected by a conducting wire, an electric current (charges) will flow, as shown in Figure 19.2. Electrons will then move from the low-potential terminal of the battery (the negative end) through the wire and enter the high-potential terminal of the battery (the positive end).\n\nElectric current is the rate at which electric charge moves. A large current, such as that used to start a truck engine, moves a large amount very quickly, whereas a small current, such as that used to operate a hand-held calculator, moves a small amount of charge more slowly. In equation form, electric current I is defined as\n\n$$\\[I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(\\Delta Q\\)$$  is the amount of charge that flows past a given area and  $$\\(\\Delta t\\)$$  is the time it takes for the charge to move past the area. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), which is named in honor of the French physicist Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re (1775\u20131836). One ampere is one coulomb per second, or\n\n$$\\[1\\;\\text{A} = 1\\;\\text{C/s.}\\]$$\n\nElectric current moving through a wire is in many ways similar to water current moving through a pipe. To define the flow of water through a pipe, we can count the water molecules that flow past a given section of the pipe. As shown in Figure 19.3, electric current is very similar. We count the number of electrical charges that flow past a section of a conductor; in this case, a wire.\n\nAssume each particle q in Figure 19.3 carries a charge  $$\\(q = 1\\;\\text{nC}\\)$$, in which case the total charge shown would be  $$\\(\\Delta Q = 5q = 5\\;\\text{nC}\\)$$ . If these charges move past the area A in a time  $$\\(\\Delta t = 1\\;\\text{ns}\\)$$, then the current would be\n\n$$\\[I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{5\\;\\text{nC}}{1\\;\\text{ns}} = 5\\;\\text{A.}\\]$$\n\nNote that we assigned a positive charge to the charges in Figure 19.3. Normally, negative charges\u2014electrons\u2014are the mobile charge in wires, as indicated in Figure 19.2. Positive charges are normally stuck in place in solids and cannot move freely. However, because a positive current moving to the right is the same as a negative current of equal magnitude moving to the left, as shown in Figure 19.4, we define conventional current to flow in the direction that a positive charge would flow if it could move. Thus, unless otherwise specified, an electric current is assumed to be composed of positive charges.\n\nAlso note that one Coulomb is a significant amount of electric charge, so 5 A is a very large current. Most often you will see current on the order of milliamperes (mA).\n\nThe direction of conventional current is the direction that positive charge would flow. Depending on the situation, positive charges, negative charges, or both may move. In metal wires, as we have seen, current is carried by electrons, so the negative charges move. In ionic solutions, such as salt water, both positively charged and negatively charged ions move. This is also true in nerve cells. Pure positive currents are relatively rare but do occur. History credits American politician and scientist Benjamin Franklin with describing current as the direction that positive charges flow through a wire. He named the type of charge associated with electrons negative long before they were known to carry current in so many situations.\n\nAs electrons move through a metal wire, they encounter obstacles such as other electrons, atoms, impurities, etc. The electrons scatter from these obstacles, as depicted in Figure 19.5. Normally, the electrons lose energy with each interaction. 1 To keep the electrons moving thus requires a force, which is supplied by an electric field. The electric field in a wire points from the end of the wire at the higher potential to the end of the wire at the lower potential. Electrons, carrying a negative charge, move on average (or drift) in the direction opposite the electric field, as shown in Figure 19.5.\n\nSo far, we have discussed current that moves constantly in a single direction. This is called direct current, because the electric charge flows in only one direction. Direct current is often called DC current.\n\nMany sources of electrical power, such as the hydroelectric dam shown at the beginning of this chapter, produce alternating current, in which the current direction alternates back and forth. Alternating current is often called AC current. Alternating current moves back and forth at regular time intervals, as shown in Figure 19.6. The alternating current that comes from a normal wall socket does not suddenly switch directions. Rather, it increases smoothly up to a maximum current and then smoothly decreases back to zero. It then grows again, but in the opposite direction until it has reached the same maximum value. After that, it decreases smoothly back to zero, and the cycle starts over again.\n\nDevices that use AC include vacuum cleaners, fans, power tools, hair dryers, and countless others. These devices obtain the power they require when you plug them into a wall socket. The wall socket is connected to the power grid that provides an alternating potential (AC potential). When your device is plugged in, the AC potential pushes charges back and forth in the circuit of the device, creating an alternating current.\n\nMany devices, however, use DC, such as computers, cell phones, flashlights, and cars. One source of DC is a battery, which provides a constant potential (DC potential) between its terminals. With your device connected to a battery, the DC potential pushes charge in one direction through the circuit of your device, creating a DC current. Another way to produce DC current is by using a transformer, which converts AC potential to DC potential. Small transformers that you can plug into a wall socket are used to charge up your laptop, cell phone, or other electronic device. People generally call this a charger or a battery, but it is a transformer that transforms AC voltage into DC voltage. The next time someone asks to borrow your laptop charger, tell them that you don\u2019t have a laptop charger, but that they may borrow your converter.",

                    "context": "As mentioned previously, electrical current in a wire is in many ways similar to water flowing through a pipe. The water current that can flow through a pipe is affected by obstacles in the pipe, such as clogs and narrow sections in the pipe. These obstacles slow down the flow of current through the pipe. Similarly, electrical current in a wire can be slowed down by many factors, including impurities in the metal of the wire or collisions between the charges in the material. These factors create a resistance to the electrical current. Resistance is a description of how much a wire or other electrical component opposes the flow of charge through it.In the 19th century, the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787\u20131854) found experimentally that current through a conductor is proportional to the voltage drop across a current-carrying conductor.\n\n$$\\[I \\propto V\\]$$\n\nThe constant of proportionality is the resistance R of the material, which leads to\n\n$$\\[V = IR\\text{(1.3).}\\]$$\n\nThis relationship is called Ohm\u2019s law. It can be viewed as a cause-and-effect relationship, with voltage being the cause and the current being the effect. Ohm\u2019s law is an empirical law like that for friction, which means that it is an experimentally observed phenomenon. The units of resistance are volts per ampere, or V/A. We call a V/A an ohm, which is represented by the uppercase Greek letter omega ( $$\\(\\text{\u03a9}\\)$$ ). Thus,\n\n$$\\[1\\;\\text{\u03a9} = 1\\;\\text{V/A}\\text{(1.4).}\\]$$\n\nOhm\u2019s law holds for most materials and at common temperatures. At very low temperatures, resistance may drop to zero (superconductivity). At very high temperatures, the thermal motion of atoms in the material inhibits the flow of electrons, increasing the resistance. The many substances for which Ohm\u2019s law holds are called ohmic. Ohmic materials include good conductors like copper, aluminum, and silver, and some poor conductors under certain circumstances. The resistance of ohmic materials remains essentially the same for a wide range of voltage and current.",

                    "context": "Now that we understand the concept of electric current, let\u2019s see what we can do with it. As you are no doubt aware, the modern lifestyle relies heavily on electrical devices. These devices contain ingenious electric circuits, which are complete, closed pathways through which electric current flows. Returning to our water analogy, an electric circuit is to electric charge like a network of pipes is to water: The electric circuit guides electric charge from one point to the next, running the charge through various devices along the way to extract work or information.\n\nElectric circuits are made from many materials and cover a huge range of sizes, as shown in Figure 19.8. Computers and cell phones contain electric circuits whose features can be as small as roughly a billionth of a meter (a nanometer, or  $$\\(10^{-9}\\text{m}\\)$$ ). The pathways that guide the current in these devices are made by ultraprecise chemical treatments of silicon or other semiconductors. Large power systems, on the other hand, contain electric circuits whose features are on the scale of meters. These systems carry such large electric currents that their physical dimensions must be relatively large.\n\nThe pathways that form electric circuits are made from a conducting material, normally a metal in macroscopic circuits. For example, copper wires inside your school building form the electrical circuits that power lighting, projectors, screens, speakers, etc. To represent an electric circuit, we draw circuit diagrams. We use lines and symbols to represent the elements in the circuit. A simple electric circuit diagram is shown on the left side of Figure 19.9. On the right side is an analogous water circuit, which we discuss below.\n\nThere are many different symbols that scientists and engineers use in circuit diagrams, but we will focus on four main symbols: the wire, the battery or voltage source, resistors, and the ground. The thin black lines in the electric circuit diagram represent the pathway that the electric charge must follow. These pathways are assumed to be perfect conductors, so electric charge can move along these pathways without losing any energy. In reality, the wires in circuits are not perfect, but they come close enough for our purposes.\n\nThe zigzag element labeled R is a resistor, which is a circuit element that provides a known resistance. Macroscopic resistors are often color coded to indicate their resistance, as shown in Figure 19.10.\n\nThe red element in Figure 19.9 is a battery, with its positive and negative terminals indicated; the longer line represents the positive terminal of the battery, and the shorter line represents the negative terminal. Note that the battery icon is not always colored red; this is done in Figure 19.9 just to make it easy to identify.\n\nFinally, the element labeled ground on the lower left of the circuit indicates that the circuit is connected to Earth, which is a large, essentially neutral object containing an infinite amount of charge. Among other things, the ground determines the potential of the negative terminal of the battery. Normally, the potential of the ground is defined to be zero:  $$\\(V_{\\text{ground}} \\equiv 0\\)$$ . This means that the entire lower wire in Figure 19.10 is at a voltage of zero volts.\n\nThe electric current in Figure 19.9 is indicted by the blue line labeled I. The arrow indicates the direction in which positive charge would flow in this circuit. Recall that, in metals, electrons are mobile charge carriers, so negative charges actually flow in the opposite direction around this circuit (i.e., counterclockwise). However, we draw the current to show the direction in which positive charge would move.\n\nOn the right side of Figure 19.9 is an analogous water circuit. Water at a higher pressure leaves the top of the pump, which is like charges leaving the positive terminal of the battery. The water travels through the pipe, like the charges traveling through the wire. Next, the water goes through a sand filter, which heats up as the water squeezes through. This step is like the charges going through the resistor. When charges flow through a resistor, they do work to heat up the resistor. After flowing through the sand filter, the water has converted its potential energy into heat, so it is at a lower pressure. Likewise, the charges exiting the resistor have converted their potential energy into heat, so they are at a lower voltage. Recall that voltage is just potential energy per charge. Thus, water pressure is analogous to electric potential energy (i.e., voltage). Coming back to the water circuit again, we see that the water returns to the bottom of the pump, which is like the charge returning to the negative terminal of the battery. The water pump uses a source of energy to pump the water back up to a high pressure again, giving it the pressure required to go through the circuit once more. The water pump is like the battery, which uses chemical energy to increase the voltage of the charge up to the level of the positive terminal.\n\nThe potential energy per charge at the positive terminal of the battery is the voltage rating of the battery. This voltage is like water pressure in the upper pipe. Just like a higher pressure forces water to move toward a lower pressure, a higher voltage forces electric charge to flow toward a lower voltage. The pump takes water at low pressure and does work on it, ejecting water at a higher pressure. Likewise, a battery takes charge at a low voltage, does work on it, and ejects charge at a higher voltage.\n\nNote that the current in the water circuit of Figure 19.9 is the same throughout the circuit. In other words, if we measured the number of water molecules passing a cross-section of the pipe per unit time at any point in the circuit, we would get the same answer no matter where in the circuit we measured. The same is true of the electrical circuit in the same figure. The electric current is the same at all points in this circuit, including inside the battery and in the resistor. The electric current neither speeds up in the wires nor slows down in the resistor. This would create points where too much or too little charge would be bunched up. Thus, the current is the same at all points in the circuit shown in Figure 19.9.\n\nAlthough the current is the same everywhere in both the electric and water circuits, the voltage or water pressure changes as you move through the circuits. In the water circuit, the water pressure at the pump outlet stays the same until the water goes through the sand filter, assuming no energy loss in the pipe. Likewise, the voltage in the electrical circuit is the same at all points in a given wire, because we have assumed that the wires are perfect conductors. Thus, as indicated by the constant red color of the upper wire in Figure 19.11, the voltage throughout this wire is constant at  $$\\(V = V_{\\text{battery}}\\)$$ . The voltage then drops as you go through the resistor, but once you reach the blue wire, the voltage stays at its new level of  $$\\(V = 0\\)$$  all the way to the negative terminal of the battery (i.e., the blue terminal of the battery).\n\nIf we go from the blue wire through the battery to the red wire, the voltage increases from  $$\\(V = 0\\)$$ to  $$\\(V = V_{\\text{battery}}\\)$$ . Likewise, if we go from the blue wire up through the resistor to the red wire, the voltage also goes from  $$\\(V = 0\\)$$  to  $$\\(V = V_{\\text{battery}}\\)$$ . Thus, using Ohm\u2019s law, we can write\n\n $$\\[V_{\\text{resistor}} = V_{\\text{battery}} = IR\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nNote that  $$\\(V_{\\text{resistor}}\\)$$  is measured from the bottom of the resistor to the top, meaning that the top of the resistor is at a higher voltage than the bottom of the resistor. Thus, current flows from the top of the resistor or higher voltage to the bottom of the resistor or lower voltage.\n\nOther possible circuit elements include capacitors and switches. These are drawn as shown on the left side of Figure 19.12. A switch is a device that opens and closes the circuit, like a light switch. It is analogous to a valve in a water circuit, as shown on the right side of Figure 19.12. With the switch open, no current passes through the circuit. With the switch closed, it becomes part of the wire, so the current passes through it with no loss of voltage.\n\nThe capacitor is labeled C on the left of Figure 19.12. A capacitor in an electrical circuit is analogous to a flexible membrane in a water circuit. When the switch is closed in the circuit of Figure 19.12, the battery forces electrical current to flow toward the capacitor, charging the upper capacitor plate with positive charge. As this happens, the voltage across the capacitor plates increases. This is like the membrane in the water circuit: When the valve is opened, the pump forces water to flow toward the membrane, making it stretch to store the excess water. As this happens, the pressure behind the membrane increases. \n\nNow if we open the switch, the capacitor holds the voltage between its plates because the charges have nowhere to go. Likewise, if we close the valve, the water has nowhere to go and the membrane maintains the water pressure in the pipe between itself and the valve.\n\nIf the switch is closed for a long time in the electric circuit or if the valve is open for a long time in the water circuit, the current will eventually stop flowing because the capacitor or the membrane will have become completely charged. Each circuit is now in the steady state, which means that its characteristics do not change over time. In this case, the steady state is characterized by zero current, and this does not change as long as the switch or valve remains in the same position. In the steady state, no electrical current passes through the capacitor, and no water current passes through the membrane. The voltage difference between the capacitor plates will be the same as the battery voltage. In the water circuit, the pressure behind the membrane will be the same as the pressure created by the pump.\n\nAlthough the circuit in Figure 19.12 may seem a bit pointless because all that happens when the switch is closed is that the capacitor charges up, it does show the capacitor\u2019s ability to store charge. Thus, the capacitor serves as a reservoir for charge. This property of capacitors is used in circuits in many ways. For example, capacitors are used to power circuits while batteries are being charged. In addition, capacitors can serve as filters. To understand this, let\u2019s go back to the water analogy. Suppose you have a water hose and are watering your garden. Your friend thinks he\u2019s funny, and kinks the hose. While the hose is kinked, you experience no water flow. When he lets go, the water starts flowing again. If he does this really fast, you experience water-no water-water-no water, and that\u2019s really no way to water your garden. Now imagine that the hose is filling up a big bucket, and you are watering from the bottom of the bucket. As long as you had water in your bucket to begin with and your friend doesn\u2019t kink the water hose for too long, you would be able to water your garden without the interruptions. Your friend kinking the water hose is filtered by the big bucket\u2019s supply of water, so it does not impact your ability to water the garden. We can think of the interruptions in the current (be it water or electrical current) as noise. Capacitors act in an analogous way as the water bucket to help filter out the noise. Capacitors have so many uses that it is very rare to find an electronic circuit that does not include some capacitors. ",

                    "context": "Now that we have a basic idea of how electrical circuits work, let\u2019s see what happens in circuits with more than one circuit element. In this section, we look at resistors in series. Components connected in series are connected one after the other in the same branch of a circuit, such as the resistors connected in series on the left side of Figure 19.14.\n\nWe will now try to find a single resistance that is equivalent to the three resistors in series on the left side of Figure 19.14. An equivalent resistor is a resistor that has the same resistance as the combined resistance of a set of other resistors. In other words, the same current will flow through the left and right circuits in Figure 19.14 if we use the equivalent resistor in the right circuit.\n\nAccording to Ohm\u2019s law, the voltage drop V across a resistor when a current flows through it is  $$\\(V = IR\\)$$  where I is the current in amperes (A) and R is the resistance in ohms ( $$\\(\\Omega\\)$$ ). Another way to think of this is that V is the voltage necessary to make a current I flow through a resistance R. Applying Ohm\u2019s law to each resistor on the left circuit of Figure 19.14, we find that the voltage drop across  $$\\(R_{1}\\)$$  is  $$\\(V_{1} = IR_{1}\\)$$, that across  $$\\(R_{2}\\)$$  is  $$\\(V_{2} = IR_{2}\\)$$, and that across  $$\\(R_{3}\\)$$  is  $$\\(V_{3} = IR_{3}\\)$$ . The sum of these voltages equals the voltage output of the battery, that is\n\n$$\\[V_{\\text{battery}} = V_{1} + V_{2} + V_{3}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nYou may wonder why voltages must add up like this. One way to understand this is to go once around the circuit and add up the successive changes in voltage. If you do this around a loop and get back to the starting point, the total change in voltage should be zero, because you end up at the same place that you started. To better understand this, consider the analogy of going for a stroll through some hilly countryside. If you leave your car and walk around, then come back to your car, the total height you gained in your stroll must be the same as the total height you lost, because you end up at the same place as you started. Thus, the gravitational potential energy you gain must be the same as the gravitational potential energy you lose. The same reasoning holds for voltage in going around an electric circuit. Let\u2019s apply this reasoning to the left circuit in Figure 19.14. We start just below the battery and move up through the battery, which contributes a voltage gain of  $$\\(V_{\\text{battery}}\\)$$ . Next, we got through the resistors. The voltage drops by  $$\\(V_{1}\\)$$  in going through resistor  $$\\(R_{1}\\)$$, by  $$\\(V_{2}\\)$$  in going through resistor  $$\\(R_{2}\\)$$, and by  $$\\(V_{3}\\)$$  in going through resistor  $$\\(R_{3}\\)$$ . After going through resistor  $$\\(R_{3}\\)$$, we arrive back at the starting point, so we add up these four changes in voltage and set the sum equal to zero. This gives\n\n$$\\[0 = V_{\\text{battery}} - V_{1} - V_{2} - V_{3}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nwhich is the same as the previous equation. Note that the minus signs in front of  $$\\(V_{\\text{1}}\\text{~,}V_{\\text{2}}\\text{~,~and~}V_{3}\\)$$  are because these are voltage drops, whereas  $$\\(V_{\\text{battery}}\\)$$  is a voltage rise.\n\nOhm\u2019s law tells us that  $$\\(V_{1} = IR_{1}\\)$$,  $$\\(V_{2} = IR_{2}\\)$$, and  $$\\(V_{3} = IR_{3}\\)$$ . Inserting these values into equation  $$\\(V_{\\text{battery}} = V_{1} + V_{2} + V_{3}\\)$$  gives\n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\nV_{\\text{battery}} & = & {IR_{1} + IR_{2} + IR_{3}} \\\\\n & = & {I\\left( {R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3}} \\right)\\text{.}} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nApplying this same logic to the right circuit inFigure 19.14 gives\n\n$$\\[V_{\\text{battery}} = IR_{\\text{equiv.}}\\]$$\n\nDividing the equation  $$\\(V_{\\text{battery}} = I\\left( {R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3}} \\right)\\)$$  by  $$\\(V_{\\text{battery}} = IR_{\\text{equiv}}\\)$$, we get\n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\frac{V_{\\text{battery}}}{V_{\\text{battery}}} & = & \\frac{I\\left( {R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3}} \\right)}{IR_{\\text{equiv}}} \\\\\nR_{\\text{equiv}} & = & {R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3}\\text{.}} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nThis shows that the equivalent resistance for a series of resistors is simply the sum of the resistances of each resistor. In general, N resistors connected in series can be replaced by an equivalent resistor with a resistance of\n\n$$\\[{R_{\\text{equiv}} = R_{1} + R_{2} + \\cdots + R_{N}}\\text{.}\\]$$",

                    "context": "In the previous section, we learned that resistors in series are resistors that are connected one after the other. If we instead combine resistors by connecting them next to each other, as shown in Figure 19.16, then the resistors are said to be connected in parallel. Resistors are in parallel when both ends of each resistor are connected directly together.\n\nNote that the tops of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the top of the each resistor is the same. Likewise, the bottoms of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the bottom of each resistor is the same. This means that the voltage drop across each resistor is the same. In this case, the voltage drop is the voltage rating V of the battery, because the top and bottom wires connect to the positive and negative terminals of the battery, respectively.\n\nAlthough the voltage drop across each resistor is the same, we cannot say the same for the current running through each resistor. Thus,  $$\\(I_{1},I_{2},\\text{and}I_{3}\\)$$  are not necessarily the same, because the resistors  $$\\(R_{1},R_{2},\\text{and}R_{3}\\)$$  do not necessarily have the same resistance.\n\nNote that the three resistors in Figure 19.16 provide three different paths through which the current can flow. This means that the equivalent resistance for these three resistors must be less than the smallest of the three resistors. To understand this, imagine that the smallest resistor is the only path through which the current can flow. Now add on the alternate paths by connecting other resistors in parallel. Because the current has more paths to go through, the overall resistance (i.e., the equivalent resistance) will decrease. Therefore, the equivalent resistance must be less than the smallest resistance of the parallel resistors.\n\nTo find the equivalent resistance  $$\\(R_{\\text{equiv}}\\)$$  of the three resistors  $$\\(R_{1},R_{2},\\text{and}R_{3}\\)$$, we apply Ohm\u2019s law to each resistor. Because the voltage drop across each resistor is V, we obtain\n\n$$\\[V = I_{1}R_{1},\\quad V = I_{2}R_{2},\\quad V = I_{3}R_{3}\\]$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\[I_{1} = \\frac{V}{R_{1}},\\quad I_{2} = \\frac{V}{R_{2}},\\quad I_{3} = \\frac{V}{R_{3}\\text{.}}\\]$$\n\nWe also know from conservation of charge that the three currents  $$\\(I_{1},I_{2},\\text{and}I_{3}\\)$$  must add up to give the current I that goes through the battery. If this were not true, current would have to be mysteriously created or destroyed somewhere in the circuit, which is physically impossible. Thus, we have\n\n$$\\[I = I_{1} + I_{2} + I_{3}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nInserting the expressions for  $$\\(I_{1},I_{2},\\text{and}I_{3}\\)$$  into this equation gives\n\n$$\\[I = \\frac{V}{R_{1}} + \\frac{V}{R_{2}} + \\frac{V}{R_{3}} = V\\left( {\\frac{1}{R_{1}} + \\frac{1}{R_{2}} + \\frac{1}{R_{3}}} \\right)\\]$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\[V = I\\left( \\frac{1}{{1/R_{1}} + {1/R_{2}} + {1/R_{3}}} \\right)\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis formula is just Ohm\u2019s law, with the factor in parentheses being the equivalent resistance.\n\n$$\\[V = I\\left( \\frac{1}{{1/R_{1}} + {1/R_{2}} + {1/R_{3}}} \\right) = IR_{\\text{equiv.}}\\]$$\n\nThus, the equivalent resistance for three resistors in parallel is\n\n$$\\[R_{\\text{equiv}} = \\frac{1}{{1/R_{1}} + {1/R_{2}} + {1/R_{3}}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThe same logic works for any number of resistors in parallel, so the general form of the equation that gives the equivalent resistance of N resistors connected in parallel is\n\n$$\\[R_{\\text{equiv}} = \\frac{1}{{1/R_{1}} + {1/R_{2}} + \\cdots + {1/R_{N}}}\\text{.}\\]$$",

                    "context": "More complex connections of resistors are sometimes just combinations of series and parallel. Combinations of series and parallel resistors can be reduced to a single equivalent resistance by using the technique illustrated in Figure 19.17. Various parts are identified as either series or parallel, reduced to their equivalents, and further reduced until a single resistance is left. The process is more time consuming than difficult.\n\nLet\u2019s work through the four steps in Figure 19.17 to reduce the seven resistors to a single equivalent resistor. To avoid distracting algebra, we\u2019ll assume each resistor is 10  $$\\(\\text{\u03a9}\\)$$ . In step 1, we reduce the two sets of parallel resistors circled by the blue dashed loop. The upper set has three resistors in parallel and will be reduced to a single equivalent resistor  $$\\(R_{\\text{P1}}\\)$$ . The lower set has two resistors in parallel and will be reduced to a single equivalent resistor  $$\\(R_{\\text{P2}}\\)$$ . Using the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel, we obtain\n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{rclclcl}\nR_{\\text{P1}} & = & \\frac{1}{1/{R_{2} + {1/{R_{3} + {1/R_{4}}}}}} & = & \\frac{1}{1/{10\\;\\text{\u03a9} + {1/{10\\;\\text{\u03a9} + {1/{10\\;\\text{\u03a9}}}}}}} & = & {\\frac{10}{3}\\text{\u03a9}} \\\\\nR_{\\text{P2}} & = & \\frac{1}{1/{R_{5} + {1/R_{6}}}} & = & \\frac{1}{1/{10\\;\\text{\u03a9} + {1/{10\\;\\text{\u03a9}}}}} & = & {5\\;\\text{\u03a9.}} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nThese two equivalent resistances are encircled by the red dashed loop following step 1. They are in series, so we can use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in series to reduce them to a single equivalent resistance  $$\\(R_{\\text{S1}}\\)$$ . This is done in step 2, with the result being\n\n$$\\[R_{\\text{S1}} = R_{\\text{P1}} + R_{\\text{P2}} = \\frac{10}{3}\\text{\u03a9} + 5\\;\\text{\u03a9} = \\frac{25}{3}\\text{\u03a9.}\\]$$\n\nThe equivalent resistor  $$\\(R_{\\text{S1}}\\)$$  appears in the green dashed loop following step 2. This resistor is in parallel with resistor  $$\\(R_{\\text{7}}\\)$$, so the pair can be replaced by the equivalent resistor  $$\\(R_{\\text{P3}}\\)$$, which is given by\n\n$$\\[R_{\\text{P3}} = \\frac{1}{1/{R_{\\text{S1}} + {1/R_{7}}}} = \\frac{1}{{3/{25\\;\\text{\u03a9}}} + {1/{10\\;\\text{\u03a9}}}} = \\frac{50}{11}\\text{\u03a9.}\\]$$\n\nThis is done in step 3. The resistor  $$\\(R_{\\text{P3}}\\)$$  is in series with the resistor  $$\\(R_{\\text{1}}\\)$$, as shown in the purple dashed loop following step 3. These two resistors are combined in the final step to form the final equivalent resistor  $$\\(R_{\\text{equiv}}\\)$$, which is\n\n$$\\[R_{\\text{equiv}} = R_{\\text{1}} + R_{\\text{P3}} = 10\\;\\text{\u03a9} + \\frac{50}{11}\\text{\u03a9} = \\frac{160}{11}\\text{\u03a9.}\\]$$\n\nThus, the entire combination of seven resistors may be replaced by a single resistor with a resistance of about 14.5  $$\\(\\text{\u03a9}\\)$$ .\n\nThat was a lot of work, and you might be asking why we do it. It\u2019s important for us to know the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit so that we can calculate the current flowing through the circuit. Ohm\u2019s law tells us that the current flowing through a circuit depends on the resistance of the circuit and the voltage across the circuit. But to know the current, we must first know the equivalent resistance.\n\nHere is a general approach to find the equivalent resistor for any arbitrary combination of resistors:\n\nIdentify a group of resistors that are only in parallel or only in series. For resistors in series, use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in series to reduce them to a single equivalent resistance. For resistors in parallel, use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel to reduce them to a single equivalent resistance. Draw a new circuit diagram with the resistors from step 1 replaced by their equivalent resistor. If more than one resistor remains in the circuit, return to step 1 and repeat. Otherwise, you are finished. ",

                    "context": "Power is associated by many people with electricity. Every day, we use electric power to run our modern appliances. Electric power transmission lines are visible examples of electricity providing power. We also use electric power to start our cars, to run our computers, or to light our homes. Power is the rate at which energy of any type is transferred; electric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred in a circuit. In this section, we\u2019ll learn not only what this means, but also what factors determine electric power. \n\nTo get started, let\u2019s think of light bulbs, which are often characterized in terms of their power ratings in watts. Let us compare a 25-W bulb with a 60-W bulb (see Figure 19.20). Although both operate at the same voltage, the 60-W bulb emits more light intensity than the 25-W bulb. This tells us that something other than voltage determines the power output of an electric circuit. \n\nIncandescent light bulbs, such as the two shown in Figure 19.20, are essentially resistors that heat up when current flows through them and they get so hot that they emit visible and invisible light. Thus the two light bulbs in the photo can be considered as two different resistors. In a simple circuit such as a light bulb with a voltage applied to it, the resistance determines the current by Ohm\u2019s law, so we can see that current as well as voltage must determine the power.\n\nThe formula for power may be found by dimensional analysis. Consider the units of power. In the SI system, power is given in watts (W), which is energy per unit time, or J/s\n\n$$\\[\\text{W} = \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{s}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nRecall now that a voltage is the potential energy per unit charge, which means that voltage has units of J/C\n\n$$\\[\\text{V} = \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{C}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as  $$\\(\\text{J} = \\text{V}\\  \\times \\ \\text{C}\\)$$  and substitute this into the equation for watts to get\n\n$$\\[\\text{W} = \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{s}} = \\frac{\\text{V}\\  \\times \\ \\text{C}}{\\text{s}} = \\text{V}\\  \\times \\ \\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{s}}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nBut a Coulomb per second (C/s) is an electric current, which we can see from the definition of electric current,  $$\\(I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}\\)$$, where  $$\\(\\Delta\\)$$ Q is the charge in coulombs and  $$\\(\\Delta\\)$$ t is time in seconds. Thus, equation above tells us that electric power is voltage times current, or\n\n$$\\[P = IV\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis equation gives the electric power consumed by a circuit with a voltage drop of V and a current of I.\n\nFor example, consider the circuit in Figure 19.21. From Ohm\u2019s law, the current running through the circuit is\n\n$$\\[I = \\frac{V}{R} = \\frac{12\\;\\text{V}}{100\\;\\text{\u03a9}} = 0.12\\;\\text{A.}\\]$$\n\nThus, the power consumed by the circuit is\n\n$$\\[P = VI = \\left( {12\\;\\text{V}} \\right)\\left( {0.12\\;\\text{A}} \\right) = 1.4\\;\\text{W.}\\]$$\n\nWhere does this power go? In this circuit, the power goes primarily into heating the resistor in this circuit.\n\nIn calculating the power in the circuit of Figure 19.21, we used the resistance and Ohm\u2019s law to find the current. Ohm\u2019s law gives the current: $$\\(I = {V/R}\\)$$, which we can insert into the equation for electric power to obtain\n\n$$\\[P = IV = \\left( \\frac{V}{R} \\right)V = \\frac{V^{2}}{R}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis gives the power in terms of only the voltage and the resistance. \n\nWe can also use Ohm\u2019s law to eliminate the voltage in the equation for electric power and obtain an expression for power in terms of just the current and the resistance. If we write Ohm\u2019s law as  $$\\(V = IR\\)$$  and use this to eliminate V in the equation  $$\\(P = IV\\)$$, we obtain\n\n$$\\[P = IV = I\\left( {IR} \\right) = I^{2}R\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis gives the power in terms of only the current and the resistance.\n\nThus, by combining Ohm\u2019s law with the equation  $$\\(P = IV\\)$$  for electric power, we obtain two more expressions for power: one in terms of voltage and resistance and one in terms of current and resistance. Note that only resistance (not capacitance or anything else), current, and voltage enter into the expressions for electric power. This means that the physical characteristic of a circuit that determines how much power it dissipates is its resistance. Any capacitors in the circuit do not dissipate electric power\u2014on the contrary, capacitors either store electric energy or release electric energy back to the circuit.\n\nTo clarify how voltage, resistance, current, and power are all related, consider Figure 19.22, which shows the formula wheel. The quantities in the center quarter circle are equal to the quantities in the corresponding outer quarter circle. For example, to express a potential V in terms of power and current, we see from the formula wheel that  $$\\(V = {P/I}\\)$$ .",

                    "context": "People have been aware of magnets and magnetism for thousands of years. The earliest records date back to ancient times, particularly in the region of Asia Minor called Magnesia\u2014the name of this region is the source of words like magnet. Magnetic rocks found in Magnesia, which is now part of western Turkey, stimulated interest during ancient times. When humans first discovered magnetic rocks, they likely found that certain parts of these rocks attracted bits of iron or other magnetic rocks more strongly than other parts. These areas are called the poles of a magnet. A magnetic pole is the part of a magnet that exerts the strongest force on other magnets or magnetic material, such as iron. For example, the poles of the bar magnet shown in Figure 20.2 are where the paper clips are concentrated.\n\nIf a bar magnet is suspended so that it rotates freely, one pole of the magnet will always turn toward the north, with the opposite pole facing south. This discovery led to the compass, which is simply a small, elongated magnet mounted so that it can rotate freely. An example of a compass is shown Figure 20.3. The pole of the magnet that orients northward is called the north pole, and the opposite pole of the magnet is called the south pole.\n\nThe discovery that one particular pole of a magnet orients northward, whereas the other pole orients southward allowed people to identify the north and south poles of any magnet. It was then noticed that the north poles of two different magnets repel each other, and likewise for the south poles. Conversely, the north pole of one magnet attracts the south pole of other magnets. This situation is analogous to that of electric charge, where like charges repel and unlike charges attract. In magnets, we simply replace charge with pole: Like poles repel and unlike poles attract. This is summarized in Figure 20.4, which shows how the force between magnets depends on their relative orientation.\n\nConsider again the fact that the pole of a magnet that orients northward is called the north pole of the magnet. If unlike poles attract, then the magnetic pole of Earth that is close to the geographic North Pole must be a magnetic south pole! Likewise, the magnetic pole of Earth that is close to the geographic South Pole must be a magnetic north pole. This situation is depicted in Figure 20.5, in which Earth is represented as containing a giant internal bar magnet with its magnetic south pole at the geographic North Pole and vice versa. If we were to somehow suspend a giant bar magnet in space near Earth, then the north pole of the space magnet would be attracted to the south pole of Earth\u2019s internal magnet. This is in essence what happens with a compass needle: Its magnetic north pole is attracted to the magnet south pole of Earth\u2019s internal magnet.\n\nWhat happens if you cut a bar magnet in half? Do you obtain one magnet with two south poles and one magnet with two north poles? The answer is no: Each half of the bar magnet has a north pole and a south pole. You can even continue cutting each piece of the bar magnet in half, and you will always obtain a new, smaller magnet with two opposite poles. As shown in Figure 20.6, you can continue this process down to the atomic scale, and you will find that even the smallest particles that behave as magnets have two opposite poles. In fact, no experiment has ever found any object with a single magnetic pole, from the smallest subatomic particle such as electrons to the largest objects in the universe such as stars. Because magnets always have two poles, they are referred to as magnetic dipoles\u2014di means two. Below, we will see that magnetic dipoles have properties that are analogous to electric dipoles.\n\nOnly certain materials, such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium, exhibit strong magnetic effects. Such materials are called ferromagnetic, after the Latin word ferrum for iron. Other materials exhibit weak magnetic effects, which are detectable only with sensitive instruments. Not only do ferromagnetic materials respond strongly to magnets\u2014the way iron is attracted to magnets\u2014but they can also be magnetized themselves\u2014that is, they can be induced to be magnetic or made into permanent magnets (Figure 20.7). A permanent magnet is simply a material that retains its magnetic behavior for a long time, even when exposed to demagnetizing influences.\n\nWhen a magnet is brought near a previously unmagnetized ferromagnetic material, it causes local magnetization of the material with unlike poles closest, as in the right side of Figure 20.7. This causes an attractive force, which is why unmagnetized iron is attracted to a magnet. \n\nWhat happens on a microscopic scale is illustrated in Figure 7(a). Regions within the material called domains act like small bar magnets. Within domains, the magnetic poles of individual atoms are aligned. Each atom acts like a tiny bar magnet. Domains are small and randomly oriented in an unmagnetized ferromagnetic object. In response to an external magnetic field, the domains may grow to millimeter size, aligning themselves, as shown in Figure 7(b). This induced magnetization can be made permanent if the material is heated and then cooled, or simply tapped in the presence of other magnets.\n\nConversely, a permanent magnet can be demagnetized by hard blows or by heating it in the absence of another magnet. Increased thermal motion at higher temperature can disrupt and randomize the orientation and size of the domains. There is a well-defined temperature for ferromagnetic materials, which is called the Curie temperature, above which they cannot be magnetized. The Curie temperature for iron is 1,043 K (770 $$\\(\\text{\u00b0C}\\)$$ ), which is well above room temperature. There are several elements and alloys that have Curie temperatures much lower than room temperature and are ferromagnetic only below those temperatures.",

                    "context": "We have thus seen that forces can be applied between magnets and between magnets and ferromagnetic materials without any contact between the objects. This is reminiscent of electric forces, which also act over distances. Electric forces are described using the concept of the electric field, which is a force field around electric charges that describes the force on any other charge placed in the field. Likewise, a magnet creates a magnetic field around it that describes the force exerted on other magnets placed in the field. As with electric fields, the pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful for visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field.\n\nAs shown in Figure 20.9, the direction of magnetic field lines is defined to be the direction in which the north pole of a compass needle points. If you place a compass near the north pole of a magnet, the north pole of the compass needle will be repelled and point away from the magnet. Thus, the magnetic field lines point away from the north pole of a magnet and toward its south pole.\n\nMagnetic field lines can be mapped out using a small compass. The compass is moved from point to point around a magnet, and at each point, a short line is drawn in the direction of the needle, as shown in Figure 20.10. Joining the lines together then reveals the path of the magnetic field line. Another way to visualize magnetic field lines is to sprinkle iron filings around a magnet. The filings will orient themselves along the magnetic field lines, forming a pattern such as that shown on the right in Figure 20.10.\n\nWhen two magnets are brought close together, the magnetic field lines are perturbed, just as happens for electric field lines when two electric charges are brought together. Bringing two north poles together\u2014or two south poles\u2014will cause a repulsion, and the magnetic field lines will bend away from each other. This is shown in Figure 20.11, which shows the magnetic field lines created by the two closely separated north poles of a bar magnet. When opposite poles of two magnets are brought together, the magnetic field lines join together and become denser between the poles. This situation is shown in Figure 20.11.\n\nLike the electric field, the magnetic field is stronger where the lines are denser. Thus, between the two north poles in Figure 20.11, the magnetic field is very weak because the density of the magnetic field is almost zero. A compass placed at that point would essentially spin freely if we ignore Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Conversely, the magnetic field lines between the north and south poles in Figure 20.11 are very dense, indicating that the magnetic field is very strong in this region. A compass placed here would quickly align with the magnetic field and point toward the south pole on the right.\n\nNote that magnets are not the only things that make magnetic fields. Early in the nineteenth century, people discovered that electrical currents cause magnetic effects. The first significant observation was by the Danish scientist Hans Christian Oersted (1777\u20131851), who found that a compass needle was deflected by a current-carrying wire. This was the first significant evidence that the movement of electric charges had any connection with magnets. An electromagnet is a device that uses electric current to make a magnetic field. These temporarily induced magnets are called electromagnets. Electromagnets are employed for everything from a wrecking yard crane that lifts scrapped cars to controlling the beam of a 90-km-circumference particle accelerator to the magnets in medical-imaging machines (see Figure 20.12).\n\nThe magnetic field created by an electric current in a long straight wire is shown in Figure 20.13. The magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the wire. The direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. This rule shows up in several places in the study of electricity and magnetism. Applied to a straight current-carrying wire, the right-hand rule says that, with your right thumb pointed in the direction of the current, the magnetic field will be in the direction in which your right fingers curl, as shown in Figure 20.13. If the wire is very long compared to the distance r from the wire, the strength B of the magnetic field is given by\n\n$$\\[B_{\\text{straight}\\text{wire}} = \\frac{\\mu_{0}I}{2\\pi r}\\]$$\n\nwhere I is the current in the wire in amperes. The SI unit for magnetic field is the tesla (T). The symbol  $$\\(\\mu_{0}\\)$$ \u2014read \u201cmu-zero\u201d\u2014is a constant called the \u201cpermeability of free space\u201d and is given by\n\n$$\\[\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi\\  \\times \\ 10^{-7}\\text{T} \\cdot \\text{m/A.}\\]$$\n\nNow imagine winding a wire around a cylinder with the cylinder then removed. The result is a wire coil, as shown in Figure 20.14. This is called a solenoid. To find the direction of the magnetic field produced by a solenoid, apply the right-hand rule to several points on the coil. You should be able to convince yourself that, inside the coil, the magnetic field points from left to right. In fact, another application of the right-hand rule is to curl your right-hand fingers around the coil in the direction in which the current flows. Your right thumb then points in the direction of the magnetic field inside the coil: left to right in this case.\n\nEach loop of wire contributes to the magnetic field inside the solenoid. Because the magnetic field lines must form closed loops, the field lines close the loop outside the solenoid. The magnetic field lines are much denser inside the solenoid than outside the solenoid. The resulting magnetic field looks very much like that of a bar magnet, as shown in Figure 20.15. The magnetic field strength deep inside a solenoid is\n\n$$\\[B_{\\text{solenoid}} = \\mu_{0}\\frac{NI}{\\ell}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere N is the number of wire loops in the solenoid and  $$\\(\\ell\\)$$  is the length of the solenoid.",

                    "context": "If a moving electric charge, that is electric current, produces a magnetic field that can exert a force on another magnet, then the reverse should be true by Newton\u2019s third law. In other words, a charge moving through the magnetic field produced by another object should experience a force\u2014and this is exactly what we find. As a concrete example, consider Figure 20.16, which shows a charge q moving with velocity  $$\\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{v}\\)$$  through a magnetic field  $$\\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{B}\\)$$  between the poles of a permanent magnet. The magnitude F of the force experienced by this charge is\n\n$$\\[F = qvB\\sin\\theta\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  is the angle between the velocity of the charge and the magnetic field.\n\nThe direction of the force may be found by using another version of the right-hand rule: First, we join the tails of the velocity vector and a magnetic field vector, as shown in step 1 of Figure 20.16. We then curl our right fingers from  $$\\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{v}\\)$$  to  $$\\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{B}\\)$$, as indicated in step (2) of Figure 20.16. The direction in which the right thumb points is the direction of the force. For the charge in Figure 20.16, we find that the force is directed into the page.\n\nNote that the factor  $$\\(\\sin\\theta\\)$$  in the equation  $$\\(F = qvB\\sin\\theta\\)$$ means that zero force is applied on a charge that moves parallel to a magnetic field because  $$\\(\\theta = 0\\)$$  and  $$\\(\\sin 0 = 0\\)$$ . The maximum force a charge can experience is when it moves perpendicular to the magnetic field, because  $$\\(\\theta = 90{^\\circ}\\)$$ and  $$\\(\\sin 90{^\\circ} = 1\\;\\text{.}\\)$$ \n\nInstead of a single charge moving through a magnetic field, consider now a steady current I moving through a straight wire. If we place this wire in a uniform magnetic field, as shown in Figure 20.19, what is the force on the wire or, more precisely, on the electrons in the wire? An electric current involves charges that move. If the charges q move a distance  $$\\(\\ell\\)$$  in a time t, then their speed is  $$\\(v = {\\ell/t\\text{.}}\\)$$  Inserting this into the equation  $$\\(F = qvB\\sin\\theta\\)$$  gives\n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\nF & = & {q\\left( \\frac{\\ell}{t} \\right)B\\sin\\theta} \\\\\n & = & {\\left( \\frac{q}{t} \\right)\\ell B\\sin{\\theta.}} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nThe factor q/t in this equation is nothing more than the current in the wire. Thus, using  $$\\(I = {q/t}\\)$$, we obtain\n\n$$\\[F = I\\ell B\\sin\\theta\\text{(1}\\text{.4).}\\]$$\n\nThis equation gives the force on a straight current-carrying wire of length  $$\\(\\ell\\)$$  in a magnetic field of strength B. The angle  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  is the angle between the current vector and the magnetic field vector. Note that  $$\\(\\ell\\)$$  is the length of wire that is in the magnetic field and for which  $$\\(\\theta \\neq 0\\;\\text{,}\\)$$  as shown in Figure 20.19.\n\nThe direction of the force is determined in the same way as for a single charge. Curl your right fingers from the vector for I to the vector for B, and your right thumb will point in the direction of the force on the wire. For the wire shown in Figure 20.19, the force is directed into the page.\n\nThroughout this section, you may have noticed the symmetries between magnetic effects and electric effects. These effects all fall under the umbrella of electromagnetism, which is the study of electric and magnetic phenomena. We have seen that electric charges produce electric fields, and moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. A magnetic dipole produces a magnetic field, and, as we will see in the next section, moving magnetic dipoles produce an electric field. Thus, electricity and magnetism are two intimately related and symmetric phenomena.",

                    "context": "As we learned previously, a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field experiences a force\u2014recall  $$\\(F = I\\ell B\\sin\\theta\\)$$ . Electric motors, which convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, are the most common application of magnetic force on current-carrying wires. Motors consist of loops of wire in a magnetic field. When current is passed through the loops, the magnetic field exerts a torque on the loops, which rotates a shaft. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical work in the process. Figure 20.23 shows a schematic drawing of an electric motor.\n\nLet us examine the force on each segment of the loop in Figure 20.23 to find the torques produced about the axis of the vertical shaft\u2014this will lead to a useful equation for the torque on the loop. We take the magnetic field to be uniform over the rectangular loop, which has width w and height  $$\\(\\ell\\text{,}\\)$$  as shown in the figure. First, consider the force on the top segment of the loop. To determine the direction of the force, we use the right-hand rule. The current goes from left to right into the page, and the magnetic field goes from left to right in the plane of the page. Curl your right fingers from the current vector to the magnetic field vector and your right thumb points down. Thus, the force on the top segment is downward, which produces no torque on the shaft. Repeating this analysis for the bottom segment\u2014neglect the small gap where the lead wires go out\u2014shows that the force on the bottom segment is upward, again producing no torque on the shaft.\n\nConsider now the left vertical segment of the loop. Again using the right-hand rule, we find that the force exerted on this segment is perpendicular to the magnetic field, as shown in Figure 20.23. This force produces a torque on the shaft. Repeating this analysis on the right vertical segment of the loop shows that the force on this segment is in the direction opposite that of the force on the left segment, thereby producing an equal torque on the shaft. The total torque on the shaft is thus twice the toque on one of the vertical segments of the loop.\n\nTo find the magnitude of the torque as the wire loop spins, consider Figure 20.24, which shows a view of the wire loop from above. Recall that torque is defined as  $$\\(\\tau = rF\\sin\\theta\\text{,}\\)$$  where F is the applied force, r is the distance from the pivot to where the force is applied, and \u03b8 is the angle between r and F. Notice that, as the loop spins, the current in the vertical loop segments is always perpendicular to the magnetic field. Thus, the equation  $$\\(F = I\\ell B\\sin\\theta\\)$$  gives the magnitude of the force on each vertical segment as  $$\\(F = I\\ell B\\text{.}\\)$$  The distance r from the shaft to where this force is applied is w/2, so the torque created by this force is\n\n$$\\[\\tau_{\\text{segment}} = rF\\sin\\theta = {w/2}I\\ell B\\sin\\theta = \\left( {w/2} \\right)I\\ell B\\sin\\theta\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nBecause there are two vertical segments, the total torque is twice this, or\n\n$$\\[\\tau = wI\\ell B\\sin\\theta\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nIf we have a multiple loop with N turns, we get N times the torque of a single loop. Using the fact that the area of the loop is  $$\\(A = w\\ell\\text{;}\\)$$  the expression for the torque becomes\n\n$$\\[\\tau = NIAB\\sin\\theta\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis is the torque on a current-carrying loop in a uniform magnetic field. This equation can be shown to be valid for a loop of any shape.\n\nFrom the equation  $$\\(\\tau = NIAB\\sin\\theta\\text{,}\\)$$  we see that the torque is zero when  $$\\(\\theta = 0\\text{.}\\)$$  As the wire loop rotates, the torque increases to a maximum positive torque of  $$\\(w\\ell B\\)$$  when  $$\\(\\theta = 90{^\\circ}\\operatorname{}\\text{.}\\)$$  The torque then decreases back to zero as the wire loop rotates to  $$\\(\\theta = 180{^\\circ}\\operatorname{}\\text{.}\\)$$  From  $$\\(\\theta = 180{^\\circ}\\operatorname{}\\)$$  to  $$\\(\\theta = 360{^\\circ}\\operatorname{}\\text{,}\\)$$  the torque is negative. Thus, the torque changes sign every half turn, so the wire loop will oscillate back and forth.\n\nFor the coil to continue rotating in the same direction, the current is reversed as the coil passes through  $$\\(\\theta = 0\\;\\text{and}\\theta = 180{^\\circ}\\operatorname{}\\)$$  using automatic switches called brushes, as shown in Figure 20.25.\n\nConsider now what happens if we run the motor in reverse; that is, we attach a handle to the shaft and mechanically force the coil to rotate within the magnetic field, as shown in Figure 20.26. As per the equation  $$\\(F = qvB\\sin\\theta\\)$$ \u2014where  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  is the angle between the vectors  $$\\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{v}\\)$$  and  $$\\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{B}\\text{\u2014charges}\\)$$  in the wires of the loop experience a magnetic force because they are moving in a magnetic field. Again using the right-hand rule, where we curl our fingers from vector  $$\\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{v}\\)$$  to vector  $$\\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{B}\\)$$, we find that charges in the top and bottom segments feel a force perpendicular to the wire, which does not cause a current. However, charges in the vertical wires experience forces parallel to the wire, causing a current to flow through the wire and through an external circuit if one is connected. A device such as this that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy is called a generator.\n\nBecause current is induced only in the side wires, we can find the induced emf by only considering these wires. As explained in Induced Current in a Wire, motional emf in a straight wire moving at velocity v through a magnetic field B is  $$\\(E = B\\ell v\\text{,}\\)$$  where the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field. In the generator, the velocity makes an angle  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  with B (see Figure 20.27), so the velocity component perpendicular to B is  $$\\(v\\sin\\theta\\text{.}\\)$$  Thus, in this case, the emf induced on each vertical wire segment is  $$\\(E = B\\ell v\\sin\\theta\\text{,}\\)$$  and they are in the same direction. The total emf around the loop is then\n\n$$\\[E = 2B\\ell v\\sin\\theta\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nAlthough this expression is valid, it does not give the emf as a function of time. To find how the emf evolves in time, we assume that the coil is rotated at a constant angular velocity  $$\\(\\omega\\text{.}\\)$$  The angle  $$\\(\\theta\\)$$  is related to the angular velocity by  $$\\(\\theta = \\omega t\\text{,}\\)$$  so that\n\n$$\\[E = 2B\\ell v\\sin\\omega t\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nRecall that tangential velocity v is related to angular velocity  $$\\(\\omega\\)$$  by  $$\\(v = r\\omega\\text{.}\\)$$  Here,  $$\\(r = {w/2}\\)$$, so that  $$\\(v = \\left( {w\\operatorname{/2}} \\right)\\omega\\)$$  and\n\n$$\\[E = 2B\\ell\\left( {\\frac{w}{2}\\omega} \\right)\\sin\\omega t = B\\ell w\\omega\\sin\\omega t\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nNoting that the area of the loop is  $$\\(A = \\ell w\\)$$  and allowing for N wire loops, we find that\n\n$$\\[E = NAB\\omega\\sin\\omega t\\]$$\n\nis the emf induced in a generator coil of N turns and area A rotating at a constant angular velocity  $$\\(\\omega\\)$$  in a uniform magnetic field B. This can also be expressed as\n\n$$\\[E = E_{0}\\sin\\omega t\\]$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\\[E_{0} = NAB\\omega\\]$$\n\nis the maximum (peak) emf.\n\nFigure 20.28 shows a generator connected to a light bulb and a graph of the emf vs. time. Note that the emf oscillates from a positive maximum of  $$\\(E_{0}\\)$$  to a negative maximum of  $$\\({-E}_{0}\\text{.}\\)$$  In between, the emf goes through zero, which means that zero current flows through the light bulb at these times. Thus, the light bulb actually flickers on and off at a frequency of 2f, because there are two zero crossings per period. Since alternating current such as this is used in homes around the world, why do we not notice the lights flickering on and off? In the United States, the frequency of alternating current is 60 Hz, so the lights flicker on and off at a frequency of 120 Hz. This is faster than the refresh rate of the human eye, so you don\u2019t notice the flicker of the lights. Also, other factors prevent various different types of light bulbs from switching on and off so fast, so the light output is smoothed out a bit.\n\nIn real life, electric generators look a lot different than the figures in this section, but the principles are the same. The source of mechanical energy that turns the coil can be falling water\u2014hydropower\u2014steam produced by the burning of fossil fuels, or the kinetic energy of wind. Figure 20.29 shows a cutaway view of a steam turbine; steam moves over the blades connected to the shaft, which rotates the coil within the generator.\n\nAnother very useful and common device that exploits magnetic induction is called a transformer. Transformers do what their name implies\u2014they transform voltages from one value to another; the term voltage is used rather than emf because transformers have internal resistance. For example, many cell phones, laptops, video games, power tools, and small appliances have a transformer built into their plug-in unit that changes 120 V or 240 V AC into whatever voltage the device uses. Figure 20.30 shows two different transformers. Notice the wire coils that are visible in each device. The purpose of these coils is explained below.\n\nFigure 20.31 shows a laminated-coil transformer, which is based on Faraday\u2019s law of induction and is very similar in construction to the apparatus Faraday used to demonstrate that magnetic fields can generate electric currents. The two wire coils are called the primary and secondary coils. In normal use, the input voltage is applied across the primary coil, and the secondary produces the transformed output voltage. Not only does the iron core trap the magnetic field created by the primary coil, but also its magnetization increases the field strength, which is analogous to how a dielectric increases the electric field strength in a capacitor. Since the input voltage is AC, a time-varying magnetic flux is sent through the secondary coil, inducing an AC output voltage.\n\nFor the transformer shown in Figure 20.31, the output voltage  $$\\(V_{\\text{S}}\\)$$  from the secondary coil depends almost entirely on the input voltage  $$\\(V_{\\text{P}}\\)$$  across the primary coil and the number of loops in the primary and secondary coils. Faraday\u2019s law of induction for the secondary coil gives its induced output voltage  $$\\(V_{\\text{S}}\\)$$  to be\n\n$$\\[V_{S} = - N_{S}\\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{\\Delta t},\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(N_{\\text{S}}\\)$$  is the number of loops in the secondary coil and  $$\\({\\text{\u0394}\\text{\u03a6}}/{\\text{\u0394}t}\\)$$  is the rate of change of magnetic flux. The output voltage equals the induced emf  $$\\(\\text{(}V_{\\text{S}} = E_{\\text{S}}\\text{),}\\)$$  provided coil resistance is small\u2014a reasonable assumption for transformers. The cross-sectional area of the coils is the same on each side, as is the magnetic field strength, and so  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}\\text{\u03a6/\u0394}t\\)$$  is the same on each side. The input primary voltage  $$\\(V_{\\text{P}}\\)$$  is also related to changing flux by\n\n$$\\[V_{\\text{P}} = - N_{\\text{P}}\\frac{\\text{\u0394}\\text{\u03a6}}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nTaking the ratio of these last two equations yields the useful relationship\n\n$$\\[\\frac{V_{\\text{S}}}{V_{\\text{P}}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{S}}}{N_{\\text{P}}}\\left( {\\text{3}\\text{.07}} \\right)\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThis is known as the transformer equation. It simply states that the ratio of the secondary voltage to the primary voltage in a transformer equals the ratio of the number of loops in secondary coil to the number of loops in the primary coil.",

An external agent provides mechanical energy to force the loops to rotate in the magnetic field, which produces an AC voltage that drives an AC current through the loops. Transformers contain a ring made of magnetic material and, on opposite sides of the ring, two windings of wire wrap around the ring. A changing current in one wire winding creates a changing magnetic field, which is trapped in the ring and thus goes through the second winding and induces an emf in the second winding. The voltage in the second winding is proportional to the ratio of the number of loops in each winding. Transformers are used to step up and step down the voltage for power transmission. Over long distances, electric power is transmitted at high voltage to minimize the current and thereby minimize the Joule losses due to resistive heating. ",

They are also used to decrease voltages\u2014called step-down transformers\u2014to deliver power to homes and businesses. The overwhelming majority of electric power is generated by using magnetic induction, whereby a wire coil or copper disk is rotated in a magnetic field. The primary energy required to rotate the coils or disk can be provided by a variety of means. Hydroelectric power plants use the kinetic energy of water to drive electric generators. Coal or nuclear power plants create steam to drive steam turbines that turn the coils. Other sources of primary energy include wind, tides, or waves on water.\n\nOnce power is generated, it must be transmitted to the consumer, which often means transmitting power over hundreds of kilometers. To do this, the voltage of the power plant is increased by a step-up transformer, that is stepped up, and the current decreases proportionally because\n\n$$\\[P_{\\text{transmitted}} = I_{\\text{transmitted}}V_{\\text{transmitted}} \\cdot\\]$$\n\nThe lower current  $$\\(I_{\\text{transmitted}}\\)$$  in the transmission wires reduces the Joule losses, which is heating of the wire due to a current flow. This heating is caused by the small, but nonzero, resistance  $$\\(R_{\\text{wire}}\\)$$  of the transmission wires. The power lost to the environment through this heat is\n\n$$\\[P_{\\text{lost}} = I_{\\text{transmitted}}^{2}R_{\\text{wire}},\\]$$\n\nwhich is proportional to the current squared in the transmission wire. This is why the transmitted current  $$\\(I_{\\text{transmitted}}\\)$$  must be as small as possible and, consequently, the voltage must be large to transmit the power  $$\\(P_{\\text{transmitted}}\\text{\u22c5}\\)$$ \n\nVoltages ranging from 120 to 700 kV are used for transmitting power over long distances. The voltage is stepped up at the exit of the power station by a step-up transformer, as shown in Figure 20.32.\n\nOnce the power has arrived at a population or industrial center, the voltage is stepped down at a substation to between 5 and 30 kV. Finally, at individual homes or businesses, the power is stepped down again to 120, 240, or 480 V. Each step-up and step-down transformation is done with a transformer designed based on Faradays law of induction. We\u2019ve come a long way since Queen Elizabeth asked Faraday what possible use could be made of electricity.",

The current is reversed every half rotation so that the torque on the loop is always in the same direction. Electric generators contain wire loops in a magnetic field. An external agent provides mechanical energy to force the loops to rotate in the magnetic field, which produces an AC voltage that drives an AC current through the loops. Transformers contain a ring made of magnetic material and, on opposite sides of the ring, two windings of wire wrap around the ring. A changing current in one wire winding creates a changing magnetic field, which is trapped in the ring and thus goes through the second winding and induces an emf in the second winding. The voltage in the second winding is proportional to the ratio of the number of loops in each winding. Transformers are used to step up and step down the voltage for power transmission. Over long distances, electric power is transmitted at high voltage to minimize the current and thereby minimize the Joule losses due to resistive heating. ",

                    "context": "In the preceding section, we learned that a current creates a magnetic field. If nature is symmetrical, then perhaps a magnetic field can create a current. In 1831, some 12 years after the discovery that an electric current generates a magnetic field, English scientist Michael Faraday (1791\u20131862) and American scientist Joseph Henry (1797\u20131878) independently demonstrated that magnetic fields can produce currents. The basic process of generating currents with magnetic fields is called induction; this process is also called magnetic induction to distinguish it from charging by induction, which uses the electrostatic Coulomb force.\n\nWhen Faraday discovered what is now called Faraday\u2019s law of induction, Queen Victoria asked him what possible use was electricity. \u201cMadam,\u201d he replied, \u201cWhat good is a baby?\u201d Today, currents induced by magnetic fields are essential to our technological society. The electric generator\u2014found in everything from automobiles to bicycles to nuclear power plants\u2014uses magnetism to generate electric current. Other devices that use magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive chemical balances.\n\nOne experiment Faraday did to demonstrate magnetic induction was to move a bar magnet through a wire coil and measure the resulting electric current through the wire. A schematic of this experiment is shown in Figure 20.33. He found that current is induced only when the magnet moves with respect to the coil. When the magnet is motionless with respect to the coil, no current is induced in the coil, as in Figure 20.33. In addition, moving the magnet in the opposite direction (compare Figure 20.33 with Figure 20.33) or reversing the poles of the magnet (compare Figure 20.33 with Figure 20.33) results in a current in the opposite direction.",

                    "context": "If a current is induced in the coil, Faraday reasoned that there must be what he called an electromotive force pushing the charges through the coil. This interpretation turned out to be incorrect; instead, the external source doing the work of moving the magnet adds energy to the charges in the coil. The energy added per unit charge has units of volts, so the electromotive force is actually a potential. Unfortunately, the name electromotive force stuck and with it the potential for confusing it with a real force. For this reason, we avoid the term electromotive force and just use the abbreviation emf, which has the mathematical symbol  $$\\(\\varepsilon\\text{.}\\)$$  The emf may be defined as the rate at which energy is drawn from a source per unit current flowing through a circuit. Thus, emf is the energy per unit charge added by a source, which contrasts with voltage, which is the energy per unit charge released as the charges flow through a circuit.\n\nTo understand why an emf is generated in a coil due to a moving magnet, consider Figure 20.34, which shows a bar magnet moving downward with respect to a wire loop. Initially, seven magnetic field lines are going through the loop (see left-hand image). Because the magnet is moving away from the coil, only five magnetic field lines are going through the loop after a short time  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}t\\)$$  (see right-hand image). Thus, when a change occurs in the number of magnetic field lines going through the area defined by the wire loop, an emf is induced in the wire loop. Experiments such as this show that the induced emf is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field. Mathematically, we express this as\n\n$$\\[\\varepsilon \\propto \\frac{\\text{\u0394}B}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}B\\)$$  is the change in the magnitude in the magnetic field during time  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}t\\)$$  and A is the area of the loop.\n\nNote that magnetic field lines that lie in the plane of the wire loop do not actually pass through the loop, as shown by the left-most loop in Figure 20.35. In this figure, the arrow coming out of the loop is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. In Figure 20.35, as the loop is rotated from  $$\\(\\theta = 90{^\\circ}\\operatorname{}\\)$$ to  $$\\({\\theta = 0{^\\circ}\\operatorname{}}\\text{,}\\)$$  the contribution of the magnetic field lines to the emf increases. Thus, what is important in generating an emf in the wire loop is the component of the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, which is  $$\\({B\\cos\\theta}\\text{.}\\)$$ \n\nThis is analogous to a sail in the wind. Think of the conducting loop as the sail and the magnetic field as the wind. To maximize the force of the wind on the sail, the sail is oriented so that its surface vector points in the same direction as the winds, as in the right-most loop in Figure 20.35. When the sail is aligned so that its surface vector is perpendicular to the wind, as in the left-most loop in Figure 20.35, then the wind exerts no force on the sail.\n\nThus, taking into account the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the area, the proportionality  $$\\(E \\propto {{\\text{\u0394}B}/{\\text{\u0394}t}}\\)$$  becomes\n\n$$\\[E \\propto \\frac{\\text{\u0394}B\\cos\\theta}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nAnother way to reduce the number of magnetic field lines that go through the conducting loop in Figure 20.35 is not to move the magnet but to make the loop smaller. Experiments show that changing the area of a conducting loop in a stable magnetic field induces an emf in the loop. Thus, the emf produced in a conducting loop is proportional to the rate of change of the product of the perpendicular magnetic field and the loop area\n\n$$\\[\\varepsilon \\propto \\frac{\\text{\u0394}\\left\\lbrack {\\left( {B\\cos\\theta} \\right)A} \\right\\rbrack}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\text{,}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(B\\cos\\theta\\)$$  is the perpendicular magnetic field and A is the area of the loop. The product  $$\\(BA\\cos\\theta\\)$$  is very important. It is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass perpendicularly through a surface of area A. Going back to our sail analogy, it would be proportional to the force of the wind on the sail. It is called the magnetic flux and is represented by  $$\\(\\text{\u03a6}\\)$$ .\n\n$$\\[\\text{\u03a6} = BA\\cos\\theta\\]$$\n\nThe unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb), which is magnetic field per unit area, or T/m2. The weber is also a volt second (Vs).\n\nThe induced emf is in fact proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through a conducting loop.\n\n$$\\[\\varepsilon \\propto \\frac{\\Delta\\text{\u03a6}}{\\Delta t}\\]$$\n\nFinally, for a coil made from N loops, the emf is N times stronger than for a single loop. Thus, the emf induced by a changing magnetic field in a coil of N loops is\n\n$$\\[\\varepsilon \\propto N\\frac{\\text{\u0394}B\\cos\\theta}{\\text{\u0394}t}{A.}\\]$$\n\nThe last question to answer before we can change the proportionality into an equation is \u201cIn what direction does the current flow?\u201d The Russian scientist Heinrich Lenz (1804\u20131865) explained that the current flows in the direction that creates a magnetic field that tries to keep the flux constant in the loop. For example, consider again Figure 20.34. The motion of the bar magnet causes the number of upward-pointing magnetic field lines that go through the loop to decrease. Therefore, an emf is generated in the loop that drives a current in the direction that creates more upward-pointing magnetic field lines. By using the right-hand rule, we see that this current must flow in the direction shown in the figure. To express the fact that the induced emf acts to counter the change in the magnetic flux through a wire loop, a minus sign is introduced into the proportionality  $$\\(\\varepsilon \\propto {{\\text{\u0394}\\text{\u03a6}}/{\\text{\u0394}t}}\\text{.}\\)$$, which gives Faraday\u2019s law of induction.\n\n$$\\[\\varepsilon = - N\\frac{\\text{\u0394}\\text{\u03a6}}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\]$$\n\nLenz\u2019s law is very important. To better understand it, consider Figure 20.36, which shows a magnet moving with respect to a wire coil and the direction of the resulting current in the coil. In the top row, the north pole of the magnet approaches the coil, so the magnetic field lines from the magnet point toward the coil. Thus, the magnetic field  $$\\({\\overset{\\rightarrow}{B}}_{\\text{mag}} = B_{\\text{mag}}\\left( \\hat{x} \\right)\\)$$  pointing to the right increases in the coil. According to Lenz\u2019s law, the emf produced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field  $$\\({\\overset{\\rightarrow}{B}}_{\\text{coil}} = B_{\\text{coil}}\\left( {- \\hat{x}} \\right)\\)$$  inside the coil pointing to the left. This will counter the increase in magnetic flux pointing to the right. To see which way the current must flow, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field  $$\\({\\overset{\\rightarrow}{B}}_{\\text{coil,}}\\)$$  and the current will flow in the direction indicated by curling your right fingers. This is shown by the image of the right hand in the top row of Figure 20.36. Thus, the current must flow in the direction shown in Figure 4(a).\n\nIn Figure 4(b), the direction in which the magnet moves is reversed. In the coil, the right-pointing magnetic field  $$\\({\\overset{\\rightarrow}{B}}_{\\text{mag}}\\)$$  due to the moving magnet decreases. Lenz\u2019s law says that, to counter this decrease, the emf will drive a current that creates an additional right-pointing magnetic field  $$\\({\\overset{\\rightarrow}{B}}_{\\text{coil}}\\)$$  in the coil. Again, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field, and the current will flow in the direction indicate by curling your right fingers (Figure 4(b)).\n\nFinally, in Figure 4(c), the magnet is reversed so that the south pole is nearest the coil. Now the magnetic field  $$\\({\\overset{\\rightarrow}{B}}_{\\text{mag}}\\)$$  points toward the magnet instead of toward the coil. As the magnet approaches the coil, it causes the left-pointing magnetic field in the coil to increase. Lenz\u2019s law tells us that the emf induced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field pointing to the right. This will counter the increasing magnetic flux pointing to the left due to the magnet. Using the right-hand rule again, as indicated in the figure, shows that the current must flow in the direction shown in Figure 4(c).",

Black shirts, as well as all other black objects, will absorb and re-emit a significantly greater amount of radiation from the sun. This shirt is a good approximation of what is called a blackbody.\n\nA perfect blackbody is one that absorbs and re-emits all radiated energy that is incident upon it. Imagine wearing a tight shirt that did this! This phenomenon is often modeled with quite a different scenario. Imagine carving a small hole in an oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. As the temperature of this container gets hotter and hotter, the radiation out of this dark hole would increase as well, re-emitting all energy provided it by the increased temperature. The hole may even begin to glow in different colors as the temperature is increased. Like a burner on your stove, the hole would glow red, then orange, then blue, as the temperature is increased. In time, the hole would continue to glow but the light would be invisible to our eyes. This container is a good model of a perfect blackbody.\n\nIt is the analysis of blackbodies that led to one of the most consequential discoveries of the twentieth century.

In other words, it shows how the intensity of radiated light changes when a blackbody is heated to a particular temperature.\n\nIt may help to just follow the bottom-most red line labeled 3,000 K, red hot. The graph shows that when a blackbody acquires a temperature of 3,000 K, it radiates energy across the electromagnetic spectrum. However, the energy is most intensely emitted at a wavelength of approximately 1000 nm. This is in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. While a body at this temperature would appear red-hot to our eyes, it would truly appear \u2018infrared-hot\u2019 if we were able to see the entire spectrum.\n\nA few other important notes regarding Figure 21.2:\n\nAs temperature increases, the total amount of energy radiated increases. This is shown by examining the area underneath each line. Regardless of temperature, all red lines on the graph undergo a consistent pattern. While electromagnetic radiation is emitted throughout the spectrum, the intensity of this radiation peaks at one particular wavelength. As the temperature changes, the wavelength of greatest radiation intensity changes. At 4,000 K, the radiation is most intense in the yellow-green portion of the spectrum. At 6,000 K, the blackbody would radiate white hot, due to intense radiation throughout the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Remember that white light is the emission of all visible colors simultaneously. As the temperature increases, the frequency of light providing the greatest intensity increases as well. Recall the equation  $$\\(v = f\\lambda.\\)$$  Because the speed of light is constant, frequency and wavelength are inversely related. This is verified by the leftward movement of the three red lines as temperature is increased. \n\nWhile in science it is important to categorize observations, theorizing as to why the observations exist is crucial to scientific advancement. Why doesn\u2019t a blackbody emit radiation evenly across all wavelengths? Why does the temperature of the body change the peak wavelength that is radiated? Why does an increase in temperature cause the peak wavelength emitted to decrease? It is questions like these that drove significant research at the turn of the twentieth century. And within the context of these questions, Max Planck discovered something of tremendous importance.",

                    "context": "The prevailing theory at the time of Max Planck\u2019s discovery was that intensity and frequency were related by the equation  $$\\(I = \\frac{2kT}{\\lambda^{2}}.\\)$$  This equation, derived from classical physics and using wave phenomena, infers that as wavelength increases, the intensity of energy provided will decrease with an inverse-squared relationship. This relationship is graphed in Figure 21.3 and shows a troubling trend. For starters, it should be apparent that the graph from this equation does not match the blackbody graphs found experimentally. Additionally, it shows that for an object of any temperature, there should be an infinite amount of energy quickly emitted in the shortest wavelengths. When theory and experimental results clash, it is important to re-evaluate both models. The disconnect between theory and reality was termed the ultraviolet catastrophe.\n\nDue to concerns over the ultraviolet catastrophe, Max Planck began to question whether another factor impacted the relationship between intensity and wavelength. This factor, he posited, should affect the probability that short wavelength light would be emitted. Should this factor reduce the probability of short wavelength light, it would cause the radiance curve to not progress infinitely as in the classical theory, but would instead cause the curve to precipitate back downward as is shown in the 5,000 K, 4,000 K, and 3,000 K temperature lines of the graph in Figure 21.3. Planck noted that this factor, whatever it may be, must also be dependent on temperature, as the intensity decreases at lower and lower wavelengths as the temperature increases.\n\nThe determination of this probability factor was a groundbreaking discovery in physics, yielding insight not just into light but also into energy and matter itself. It would be the basis for Planck\u2019s 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics and would result in the transition of physics from classical to modern understanding. In an attempt to determine the cause of the probability factor, Max Planck constructed a new theory. This theory, which created the branch of physics called quantum mechanics, speculated that the energy radiated by the blackbody could exist only in specific numerical, or quantum, states. This theory is described by the equation  $$\\(E = nhf,\\)$$  where n is any nonnegative integer (0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026) and h is Planck\u2019s constant, given by  $$\\(h = 6.626\\  \\times \\ 10^{-34}\\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s},\\)$$  and f is frequency.\n\nThrough this equation, Planck\u2019s probability factor can be more clearly understood. Each frequency of light provides a specific quantized amount of energy. Low frequency light, associated with longer wavelengths would provide a smaller amount of energy, while high frequency light, associated with shorter wavelengths, would provide a larger amount of energy. For specified temperatures with specific total energies, it makes sense that more low frequency light would be radiated than high frequency light. To a degree, the relationship is like pouring coins through a funnel. More of the smaller pennies would be able to pass through the funnel than the larger quarters. In other words, because the value of the coin is somewhat related to the size of the coin, the probability of a quarter passing through the funnel is reduced!\n\nFurthermore, an increase in temperature would signify the presence of higher energy. As a result, the greater amount of total blackbody energy would allow for more of the high frequency, short wavelength, energies to be radiated. This permits the peak of the blackbody curve to drift leftward as the temperature increases, as it does from the 3,000 K to 4,000 K to 5,000 K values. Furthering our coin analogy, consider a wider funnel. This funnel would permit more quarters to pass through and allow for a reduction in concern about the probability factor.\n\nIn summary, it is the interplay between the predicted classical model and the quantum probability that creates the curve depicted in Figure 21.3. Just as quarters have a higher currency denomination than pennies, higher frequencies come with larger amounts of energy. However, just as the probability of a quarter passing through a fixed diameter funnel is reduced, so is the probability of a high frequency light existing in a fixed temperature object. As is often the case in physics, it is the balancing of multiple incredible ideas that finally allows for better understanding.",

Atoms, molecules, and fundamental electron and proton charges are all examples of physical entities that are quantized\u2014that is, they appear only in certain discrete values and do not have every conceivable value. On the macroscopic scale, this is not a revolutionary concept. A standing wave on a string allows only particular harmonics described by integers. Going up and down a hill using discrete stair steps causes your potential energy to take on discrete values as you move from step to step. Furthermore, we cannot have a fraction of an atom, or part of an electron\u2019s charge, or 14.33 cents. Rather, everything is built of integral multiples of these substructures.\n\nThat said, to discover quantum states within a phenomenon that science had always considered continuous would certainly be surprising. When Max Planck was able to use quantization to correctly describe the experimentally known shape of the blackbody spectrum, it was the first indication that energy was quantized on a small scale as well. This discovery earned Planck the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 and was such a revolutionary departure from classical physics that Planck himself was reluctant to accept his own idea. The general acceptance of Planck\u2019s energy quantization was greatly enhanced by Einstein\u2019s explanation of the photoelectric effect (discussed in the next section), which took energy quantization a step further.",

                    "context": "When Max Planck theorized that energy was quantized in a blackbody radiator, it is unlikely that he would have recognized just how revolutionary his idea was. Using tools similar to the light meter in Figure 21.5, it would take a scientist of Albert Einstein\u2019s stature to fully discover the implications of Max Planck\u2019s radical concept.\n\nThrough careful observations of the photoelectric effect, Albert Einstein realized that there were several characteristics that could be explained only if EM radiation is itself quantized. While these characteristics will be explained a bit later in this section, you can already begin to appreciate why Einstein\u2019s idea is very important. It means that the apparently continuous stream of energy in an EM wave is actually not a continuous stream at all. In fact, the EM wave itself is actually composed of tiny quantum packets of energy called photons.\n\nIn equation form, Einstein found the energy of a photon or photoelectron to be\n\n$$\\[E = h{f,}\\]$$\n\nwhere E is the energy of a photon of frequency f and h is Planck\u2019s constant. A beam from a flashlight, which to this point had been considered a wave, instead could now be viewed as a series of photons, each providing a specific amount of energy see Figure 21.6. Furthermore, the amount of energy within each individual photon is based upon its individual frequency, as dictated by  $$\\(E = hf.\\)$$  As a result, the total amount of energy provided by the beam could now be viewed as the sum of all frequency-dependent photon energies added together.\n\nJust as with Planck\u2019s blackbody radiation, Einstein\u2019s concept of the photon could take hold in the scientific community only if it could succeed where classical physics failed. The photoelectric effect would be a key to demonstrating Einstein\u2019s brilliance.\n\nConsider the following five properties of the photoelectric effect. All of these properties are consistent with the idea that individual photons of EM radiation are absorbed by individual electrons in a material, with the electron gaining the photon\u2019s energy. Some of these properties are inconsistent with the idea that EM radiation is a simple wave. For simplicity, let us consider what happens with monochromatic EM radiation in which all photons have the same energy hf.\n\nIf we vary the frequency of the EM radiation falling on a clean metal surface, we find the following: For a given material, there is a threshold frequency f0 for the EM radiation below which no electrons are ejected, regardless of intensity. Using the photon model, the explanation for this is clear. Individual photons interact with individual electrons. Thus if the energy of an individual photon is too low to break an electron away, no electrons will be ejected. However, if EM radiation were a simple wave, sufficient energy could be obtained simply by increasing the intensity. Once EM radiation falls on a material, electrons are ejected without delay. As soon as an individual photon of sufficiently high frequency is absorbed by an individual electron, the electron is ejected. If the EM radiation were a simple wave, several minutes would be required for sufficient energy to be deposited at the metal surface in order to eject an electron. The number of electrons ejected per unit time is proportional to the intensity of the EM radiation and to no other characteristic. High-intensity EM radiation consists of large numbers of photons per unit area, with all photons having the same characteristic energy, hf. The increased number of photons per unit area results in an increased number of electrons per unit area ejected. If we vary the intensity of the EM radiation and measure the energy of ejected electrons, we find the following: The maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons is independent of the intensity of the EM radiation. Instead, as noted in point 3 above, increased intensity results in more electrons of the same energy being ejected. If EM radiation were a simple wave, a higher intensity could transfer more energy, and higher-energy electrons would be ejected. The kinetic energy KE of an ejected electron equals the photon energy minus the binding energy BE of the electron in the specific material. An individual photon can give all of its energy to an electron. The photon\u2019s energy is partly used to break the electron away from the material. The remainder goes into the ejected electron\u2019s kinetic energy. In equation form, this is given by \n\n$$\\[KE_{e} = hf - B{E,}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(KE_{e}\\)$$  is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electron,  $$\\(hf\\)$$  is the photon\u2019s energy, and BE is the binding energy of the electron to the particular material. This equation explains the properties of the photoelectric effect quantitatively and demonstrates that BE is the minimum amount of energy necessary to eject an electron. If the energy supplied is less than BE, the electron cannot be ejected. The binding energy can also be written as  $$\\(BE = hf_{0},\\)$$  where  $$\\(f_{0}\\)$$  is the threshold frequency for the particular material. Figure 21.8 shows a graph of maximum  $$\\(KE_{e}\\)$$  versus the frequency of incident EM radiation falling on a particular material.",

If you have watched streetlights turn on automatically in response to the setting sun, stopped elevator doors from closing simply by putting your hands between them, or turned on a water faucet by sliding your hands near it, you are familiar with the electric eye, a name given to a group of devices that use the photoelectric effect for detection.\n\nAll these devices rely on photoconductive cells. These cells are activated when light is absorbed by a semi-conductive material, knocking off a free electron. When this happens, an electron void is left behind, which attracts a nearby electron. The movement of this electron, and the resultant chain of electron movements, produces a current. If electron ejection continues, further holes are created, thereby increasing the electrical conductivity of the cell. This current can turn switches on and off and activate various familiar mechanisms.\n\nOne such mechanism takes place where you may not expect it. Next time you are at the movie theater, pay close attention to the sound coming out of the speakers. This sound is actually created using the photoelectric effect! The audiotape in the projector booth is a transparent piece of film of varying width. This film is fed between a photocell and a bright light produced by an exciter lamp. As the transparent portion of the film varies in width, the amount of light that strikes the photocell varies as well. As a result, the current in the photoconductive circuit changes with the width of the filmstrip. This changing current is converted to a changing frequency, which creates the soundtrack commonly heard in the theater.",

Although strange to consider, the answer to both questions is yes.\n\nDespite the odd nature of photons, scientists prior to Einstein had long suspected that the fundamental particle of electromagnetic radiation shared properties with our more macroscopic particles. This is no clearer than when considering the photoelectric effect, where photons knock electrons out of a substance. While it is strange to think of a massless particle exhibiting momentum, it is now a well-established fact within the scientific community. Figure 21.10 shows macroscopic evidence of photon momentum.\n\nFigure 21.10 shows a comet with two prominent tails. Comet tails are composed of gases and dust evaporated from the body of the comet and ionized gas. What most people do not know about the tails is that they always point away from the Sun rather than trailing behind the comet. This can be seen in the diagram.\n\nWhy would this be the case? The evidence indicates that the dust particles of the comet are forced away from the Sun when photons strike them. Evidently, photons carry momentum in the direction of their motion away from the Sun, and some of this momentum is transferred to dust particles in collisions. The blue tail is caused by the solar wind, a stream of plasma consisting primarily of protons and electrons evaporating from the corona of the Sun.",

Around 1923, Compton observed that X-rays reflecting from materials had decreased energy and correctly interpreted this as being due to the scattering of the X-ray photons by electrons. This phenomenon could be handled as a collision between two particles\u2014a photon and an electron at rest in the material. After careful observation, it was found that both energy and momentum were conserved in the collision. See Figure 21.11. For the discovery of this conserved scattering, now known as the Compton effect, Arthur Compton was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1929.\n\nShortly after the discovery of Compton scattering, the value of the photon momentum,  $$\\(\\mathbf{p} = \\frac{h}{\\lambda},\\)$$ \n\nwas determined by Louis de Broglie. In this equation, called the de Broglie relation, h represents Planck\u2019s constant and \u03bb is the photon wavelength.\n\nWe can see that photon momentum is small, since  $$\\(\\mathbf{p} = h/\\lambda.\\)$$  and h is very small. It is for this reason that we do not ordinarily observe photon momentum. Our mirrors do not recoil when light reflects from them, except perhaps in cartoons. Compton saw the effects of photon momentum because he was observing X-rays, which have a small wavelength and a relatively large momentum, interacting with the lightest of particles, the electron.",

We now see that light can also be modeled as particles\u2014massless photons of discrete energy and momentum. We call this twofold nature the particle-wave duality, meaning that EM radiation has properties of both particles and waves. This may seem contradictory, since we ordinarily deal with large objects that never act like both waves and particles. An ocean wave, for example, looks nothing like a grain of sand. However, this so-called duality is simply a term for properties of the photon analogous to phenomena we can observe directly, on a macroscopic scale. See Figure 21.14. If this term seems strange, it is because we do not ordinarily observe details on the quantum level directly, and our observations yield either particle-like or wave-like properties, but never both simultaneously.\n\nSince we have a particle-wave duality for photons, and since we have seen connections between photons and matter in that both have momentum, it is reasonable to ask whether there is a particle-wave duality for matter as well. If the EM radiation we once thought to be a pure wave has particle properties, is it possible that matter has wave properties? The answer, strangely, is yes. The consequences of this are tremendous, as particle-wave duality has been a constant source of scientific wonder during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.",

While often taken for granted, our knowledge of the existence and structure of atoms is the result of centuries of contemplation and experimentation. The earliest known speculation on the atom dates back to the fifth century B.C., when Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus contemplated whether a substance could be divided without limit into ever smaller pieces. Since then, scientists such as John Dalton (1766\u20131844), Amadeo Avogadro (1776\u20131856), and Dmitri Mendeleev (1834\u20131907) helped to discover the properties of that fundamental structure of matter. While much could be written about any number of important scientific philosophers, this section will focus on the role played by Ernest Rutherford (1871\u20131937). Though his understanding of our most elemental matter is rooted in the success of countless prior investigations, his surprising discovery about the interior of the atom is most fundamental in explaining so many well-known phenomena.",

                    "context": "In the early 1900\u2019s, the plum pudding model was the accepted model of the atom. Proposed in 1904 by J. J. Thomson, the model suggested that the atom was a spherical ball of positive charge, with negatively charged electrons scattered evenly throughout. In that model, the positive charges made up the pudding, while the electrons acted as isolated plums. During its short life, the model could be used to explain why most particles were neutral, although with an unbalanced number of plums, electrically charged atoms could exist.\n\nWhen Ernest Rutherford began his gold foil experiment in 1909, it is unlikely that anyone would have expected that the plum pudding model would be challenged. However, using a radioactive source, a thin sheet of gold foil, and a phosphorescent screen, Rutherford would uncover something so great that he would later call it \u201cthe most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life\u201d[James, L. K. (1993). Nobel Laureates in Chemistry, 1901\u20131992. Washington, DC: American Chemical Society.] \n\nThe experiment that Rutherford designed is shown in Figure 22.2. As you can see in, a radioactive source was placed in a lead container with a hole in one side to produce a beam of positively charged helium particles, called alpha particles. Then, a thin gold foil sheet was placed in the beam. When the high-energy alpha particles passed through the gold foil, they were scattered. The scattering was observed from the bright spots they produced when they struck the phosphor screen.\n\nThe expectation of the plum pudding model was that the high-energy alpha particles would be scattered only slightly by the presence of the gold sheet. Because the energy of the alpha particles was much higher than those typically associated with atoms, the alpha particles should have passed through the thin foil much like a supersonic bowling ball would crash through a few dozen rows of bowling pins. Any deflection was expected to be minor, and due primarily to the electrostatic Coulomb force between the alpha particles and the foil\u2019s interior electric charges.\n\nHowever, the true result was nothing of the sort. While the majority of alpha particles passed through the foil unobstructed, Rutherford and his collaborators Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden found that alpha particles occasionally were scattered to large angles, and some even came back in the direction from which they came! The result, called Rutherford scattering, implied that the gold nuclei were actually very small when compared with the size of the gold atom. As shown in Figure 22.3, the dense nucleus is surrounded by mostly empty space of the atom, an idea verified by the fact that only 1 in 8,000 particles was scattered backward.\n\nAlthough the results of the experiment were published by his colleagues in 1909, it took Rutherford two years to convince himself of their meaning. Rutherford later wrote: \u201cIt was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you. On consideration, I realized that this scattering backwards ... [meant] ... the greatest part of the mass of the atom was concentrated in a tiny nucleus.\u201d In 1911, Rutherford published his analysis together with a proposed model of the atom, which was in part based on Geiger\u2019s work from the previous year. As a result of the paper, the size of the nucleus was determined to be about  $$\\(10^{-15}\\)$$  m, or 100,000 times smaller than the atom. That implies a huge density, on the order of  $$\\(10^{15}\\)$$  g/cm3, much greater than any macroscopic matter.\n\nBased on the size and mass of the nucleus revealed by his experiment, as well as the mass of electrons, Rutherford proposed the planetary model of the atom. The planetary model of the atom pictures low-mass electrons orbiting a large-mass nucleus. The sizes of the electron orbits are large compared with the size of the nucleus, and most of the atom is a vacuum. The model is analogous to how low-mass planets in our solar system orbit the large-mass Sun. In the atom, the attractive Coulomb force is analogous to gravitation in the planetary system (see Figure 22.4).",

Analysis of emission spectra shows that energy is emitted from energized gas in discrete quantities. The Bohr model of the atom describes electrons existing in discrete orbits, with discrete energies emitted and absorbed as the electrons decrease and increase in orbital energy. The energy emitted or absorbed by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined with the equation  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}E = E_{i} - E_{f}\\)$$, where  $$\\(E_{n} = \\frac{Z^{2}}{n^{2}}E_{o}\\left( {n = 1,2,3,...} \\right)\\)$$ . The wavelength of energy absorbed or emitted by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined by the equation  $$\\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R\\left( {\\frac{1}{n_{f}{}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}{}^{2}}} \\right)\\)$$, where  $$\\(R = 1.097\\  \\times \\ 10^{7}\\text{m}^{-1}\\)$$ . Described as an electron cloud, the quantum model of the atom is the result of de Broglie waves and Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle. ",

                    "context": "In 1900, Max Planck recognized that all energy radiated from a source is emitted by atoms in quantum states. How would that radical idea relate to the interior of an atom? The answer was first found by investigating the spectrum of light or emission spectrum produced when a gas is highly energized.\n\nFigure 22.5 shows how to isolate the emission spectrum of one such gas. The gas is placed in the discharge tube at the left, where it is energized to the point at which it begins to radiate energy or emit light. The radiated light is channeled by a thin slit and then passed through a diffraction grating, which will separate the light into its constituent wavelengths. The separated light will then strike the photographic film on the right.\n\nThe line spectrum shown in part (b) of Figure 22.5 is the output shown on the film for excited iron. Note that this spectrum is not continuous but discrete. In other words, only particular wavelengths are emitted by the iron source. Why would that be the case?\n\nThe spectrum of light created by excited iron shows a variety of discrete wavelengths emitted within the visible spectrum. Each element, when excited to the appropriate degree, will create a discrete emission spectrum as in part (b) of Figure 22.5. However, the wavelengths emitted will vary from element to element. The emission spectrum for iron was chosen for Figure 22.5 solely because a substantial portion of its emission spectrum is within the visible spectrum. Figure 22.6 shows the emission spectrum for hydrogen. Note that, while discrete, a large portion of hydrogen emission takes place in the ultraviolet and infrared regions.\n\nJust as an emission spectrum shows all discrete wavelengths emitted by a gas, an absorption spectrum will show all light that is absorbed by a gas. Black lines exist where the wavelengths are absorbed, with the remainder of the spectrum lit by light is free to pass through. What relationship do you think exists between the black lines of a gas\u2019s absorption spectrum and the colored lines of its emission spectrum? Figure 22.7 shows the absorption spectrum of the Sun. The black lines are called Fraunhofer lines, and they correspond to the wavelengths absorbed by gases in the Sun\u2019s exterior.",

Analysis of emission spectra shows that energy is emitted from energized gas in discrete quantities. The Bohr model of the atom describes electrons existing in discrete orbits, with discrete energies emitted and absorbed as the electrons decrease and increase in orbital energy. The energy emitted or absorbed by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined with the equation  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}E = E_{i} - E_{f}\\)$$, where  $$\\(E_{n} = \\frac{Z^{2}}{n^{2}}E_{o}\\left( {n = 1,2,3,...} \\right)\\)$$ . The wavelength of energy absorbed or emitted by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined by the equation  $$\\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R\\left( {\\frac{1}{n_{f}{}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}{}^{2}}} \\right)\\)$$, where  $$\\(R = 1.097\\  \\times \\ 10^{7}\\text{m}^{-1}\\)$$ .

                    "context": "To tie the unique signatures of emission spectra to the composition of the atom itself would require clever thinking. Niels Bohr (1885\u20131962), a Danish physicist, did just that, by making immediate use of Rutherford\u2019s planetary model of the atom. Bohr, shown in Figure 22.8, became convinced of its validity and spent part of 1912 at Rutherford\u2019s laboratory. In 1913, after returning to Copenhagen, he began publishing his theory of the simplest atom, hydrogen, based on Rutherford\u2019s planetary model.\n\nBohr was able to derive the formula for the hydrogen spectrum using basic physics, the planetary model of the atom, and some very important new conjectures. His first conjecture was that only certain orbits are allowed: In other words, in an atom, the orbits of electrons are quantized. Each quantized orbit has a different distinct energy, and electrons can move to a higher orbit by absorbing energy or drop to a lower orbit by emitting energy. Because of the quantized orbits, the amount of energy emitted or absorbed must also be quantized, producing the discrete spectra seen in Figure 22.5 and Figure 22.7. In equation form, the amount of energy absorbed or emitted can be found as\n\n$$\\[\\text{\u0394}E = E_{i} - E_{f},\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(E_{i}\\)$$  refers to the energy of the initial quantized orbit, and  $$\\(E_{f}\\)$$  refers to the energy of the final orbits. Furthermore, the wavelength emitted can be found using the equation\n\n$$\\[hf = E_{i} - E_{f},\\]$$\n\nand relating the wavelength to the frequency found using the equation  $$\\(v = f\\lambda\\)$$, where v corresponds to the speed of light.\n\nIt makes sense that energy is involved in changing orbits. For example, a burst of energy is required for a satellite to climb to a higher orbit. What is not expected is that atomic orbits should be quantized. Quantization is not observed for satellites or planets, which can have any orbit, given the proper energy (see Figure 22.9).\n\nFigure 22.10 shows an energy-level diagram, a convenient way to display energy states. Each of the horizontal lines corresponds to the energy of an electron in a different orbital. Energy is plotted vertically with the lowest or ground state at the bottom and with excited states above. The vertical arrow downwards shows energy being emitted out of the atom due to an electron dropping from one excited state to another. That would correspond to a line shown on the atom\u2019s emission spectrum. The Lyman series shown in Figure 22.6 results from electrons dropping to the ground state, while the Balmer and Paschen series result to electrons dropping to the n = 2 and n = 3 states, respectively.",

The negative value in the equation is based upon a baseline energy of zero when the electron is infinitely far from the atom.

The equation is only valid for atoms with single electrons in their orbital shells (like hydrogen). For ionized atoms similar to hydrogen, the following formula may be used.\n\n$$\\[E_{n} = \\frac{Z^{2}}{n^{2}}E_{o}\\left( {n = 1,2,3,...} \\right)\\]$$\n\nPlease note that  $$\\(E_{o}\\)$$  corresponds to \u201313.6 eV, as mentioned earlier.

While gravitation causes the motion of orbiting planets around an interior star, the Coulomb force is responsible for the circular shape of the electron\u2019s orbit. The magnitude of the centripetal force is  $$\\(\\frac{m_{e}v^{2}}{r_{n}}\\)$$, while the magnitude of the Coulomb force is  $$\\(\\frac{k\\left( {Zq_{e}} \\right)\\left( q_{e} \\right)}{r_{e}{}^{2}}\\)$$ . The assumption here is that the nucleus is more massive than the stationary electron, and the electron orbits about it. That is consistent with the planetary model of the atom.

Analysis of emission spectra shows that energy is emitted from energized gas in discrete quantities. The Bohr model of the atom describes electrons existing in discrete orbits, with discrete energies emitted and absorbed as the electrons decrease and increase in orbital energy. The energy emitted or absorbed by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined with the equation  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}E = E_{i} - E_{f}\\)$$, where  $$\\(E_{n} = \\frac{Z^{2}}{n^{2}}E_{o}\\left( {n = 1,2,3,...} \\right)\\)$$ . The wavelength of energy absorbed or emitted by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined by the equation  $$\\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R\\left( {\\frac{1}{n_{f}{}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}{}^{2}}} \\right)\\)$$, where  $$\\(R = 1.097\\  \\times \\ 10^{7}\\text{m}^{-1}\\)$$ .

That was an important first step that has been improved upon, but it is well worth repeating here, because it does correctly describe many characteristics of hydrogen. Assuming circular orbits, Bohr proposed that the angular momentum L of an electron in its orbit is also quantized, that is, it has only specific, discrete values. The value for L is given by the formula\n\n$$\\[L = m_{e}vr_{n} = n\\frac{h}{2\\pi}(n = 1,2,3,...),\\]$$\n\nwhere L is the angular momentum, me is the electron\u2019s mass, rn is the radius of the n th orbit, and h is Planck\u2019s constant. Note that angular momentum is  $$\\(L = I\\omega\\)$$ . For a small object at a radius r, $$\\(I = mr^{2}\\)$$, and  $$\\(\\omega = \\frac{v}{r}\\)$$, so that  $$\\(L = I\\omega = \\left( {mr^{2}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{v}{r} \\right) = mvr.\\)$$  Quantization says that the value of mvr can only be equal to h / 2, 2h / 2, 3h / 2, etc. At the time, Bohr himself did not know why angular momentum should be quantized, but by using that assumption, he was able to calculate the energies in the hydrogen spectrum, something no one else had done at the time.",

Analysis of emission spectra shows that energy is emitted from energized gas in discrete quantities. The Bohr model of the atom describes electrons existing in discrete orbits, with discrete energies emitted and absorbed as the electrons decrease and increase in orbital energy. The energy emitted or absorbed by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined with the equation  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}E = E_{i} - E_{f}\\)$$, where  $$\\(E_{n} = \\frac{Z^{2}}{n^{2}}E_{o}\\left( {n = 1,2,3,...} \\right)\\)$$ . The wavelength of energy absorbed or emitted by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined by the equation  $$\\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R\\left( {\\frac{1}{n_{f}{}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}{}^{2}}} \\right)\\)$$, where  $$\\(R = 1.097\\  \\times \\ 10^{7}\\text{m}^{-1}\\)$$ . Described as an electron cloud, the quantum model of the atom is the result of de Broglie waves and Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle. ",

Potential energy for the electron is electrical, or  $$\\(PE = q_{e}V\\)$$, where V is the potential due to the nucleus, which looks like a point charge. The nucleus has a positive charge  $$\\(Zq_{e}\\)$$; thus,  $$\\(V = \\frac{kZq_{e}}{r_{n}}\\)$$, recalling an earlier equation for the potential due to a point charge from the chapter on Electricity and Magnetism. Since the electron\u2019s charge is negative, we see that  $$\\(PE = \\frac{- kZq_{e}{}^{2}}{r_{n}}\\text{.}\\)$$ Substituting the expressions for KE and PE,\n\n$$\\[E_{n} = \\frac{1}{2}m_{e}v^{2} - \\frac{kZq_{e}{}^{2}}{r_{n}}.\\]$$\n\nNow we solve for rn and v using the equation for angular momentum  $$\\(L = m_{e}vr_{n} = n\\frac{h}{2\\pi}(n = 1,2,3,...)\\)$$, giving\n\n$$\\[v = n\\frac{h}{2\\pi m_{e}r_{n}}(n = 1,2,3,...)\\]$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\[r_{n} = n\\frac{h}{2\\pi m_{e}v}(n = 1,2,3,...).\\]$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for rn and v into the above expressions for energy (KE and PE), and performing algebraic manipulation, yields\n\n$$\\[E_{n} = - \\frac{Z^{2}}{n^{2}}E_{o}(n = 1,2,3,...)\\]$$\n\nfor the orbital energies of hydrogen-like atoms. Here, Eo is the ground-state energy (n = 1) for hydrogen (Z = 1) and is given by\n\n$$\\[E_{o} = \\frac{2\\pi^{2}q_{e}{}^{4}m_{e}k^{2}}{h^{2}} = 13.6\\ \\text{eV}\\text{.}\\]$$\n\nThus, for hydrogen,\n\n$$\\[E_{n} = - \\frac{13.6\\ \\text{eV}}{n^{2}}(n = 1,2,3,...\\operatorname{).}\\]$$\n\nThe relationship between orbital energies and orbital states for the hydrogen atom can be seen in Figure 22.11.\n\nThe wavelength of light emitted by an atom can also be determined through basic derivations. Let us consider the energy of a photon emitted from a hydrogen atom in a downward transition, given by the equation\n\n$$\\[\\text{\u0394}E = hf = E_{i} - E_{f}\\]$$\n\nSubstituting  $$\\(E_{n} = \\left( \\frac{-13.6\\ \\text{e}\\text{V}}{n^{2}} \\right)\\)$$, we get\n\n$$\\[hf = \\left( {13.6\\ \\text{e}\\text{V}} \\right)\\left( {\\frac{1}{n_{f}{}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}{}^{2}}}\\operatorname{).} \\right.\\]$$\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by hc gives us an expression for  $$\\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\)$$,\n\n$$\\[\\frac{hf}{hc} = \\frac{f}{c} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{13.6\\ \\text{eV}}{hc}\\left( \\frac{1}{n_{f}{}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}{}^{2}} \\right).\\]$$\n\nIt can be shown that\n\n$$\\[\\left( \\frac{13.6\\ \\text{eV}}{hc} \\right) = \\frac{(13.6\\ \\text{eV})(1.602\\  \\times \\ 10^{-19}\\text{J}/\\text{eV})}{(6.602\\  \\times \\ 10^{-34}\\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s})(2.998\\  \\times \\ 10^{8}\\text{m}/\\text{s})} = 1.097\\  \\times \\ 10^{7}\\text{m}^{-1} = R,\\]$$\n\nwhere R is the Rydberg constant.\n\nSimplified, the formula for determining emitted wavelength can now be written as\n\n$$\\[\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R\\left( \\frac{1}{n_{f}{}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}{}^{2}} \\right).\\]$$",

The wave-like properties of matter were subsequently confirmed by observations of electron interference when scattered from crystals. Electrons can exist only in locations where they interfere constructively. How does that affect electrons in atomic orbits? When an electron is bound to an atom, its wavelength must fit into a small space, something like a standing wave on a string (see Figure 22.12). Orbits in which an electron can constructively interfere with itself are allowed. All orbits in which constructive interference cannot occur are not able to exist. Thus, only certain orbits are allowed. The wave nature of an electron, according to de Broglie, is why the orbits are quantized!\n\nFor a circular orbit, constructive interference occurs when the electron\u2019s wavelength fits neatly into the circumference, so that wave crests always align with crests and wave troughs align with troughs, as shown in Figure 22.12(b). More precisely, when an integral multiple of the electron\u2019s wavelength equals the circumference of the orbit, constructive interference is obtained. In equation form, the condition for constructive interference and an allowed electron orbit is\n\n$$\\[n\\lambda_{n} = 2\\pi r_{n}(n = 1,2,3,...),\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(\\lambda_{n}\\)$$  is the electron\u2019s wavelength and rn is the radius of that circular orbit.

It is impossible to measure a physical quantity exactly, and greater precision in measuring one quantity produces less precision in measuring a related quantity. It was Werner Heisenberg who first stated that limit to knowledge in 1929 as a result of his work on quantum mechanics and the wave characteristics of all particles (see Figure 22.14).\n\nFor example, you can measure the position of a moving electron by scattering light or other electrons from it. However, by doing so, you are giving the electron energy, and therefore imparting momentum to it. As a result, the momentum of the electron is affected and cannot be determined precisely. This change in momentum could be anywhere from close to zero up to the relative momentum of the electron ( $$\\(p \\approx h/\\lambda\\)$$ ). Note that, in this case, the particle is an electron, but the principle applies to any particle.\n\nViewing the electron through the model of wave-particle duality, Heisenberg recognized that, because a wave is not located at one fixed point in space, there is an uncertainty associated with any electron\u2019s position. That uncertainty in position,  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}x\\)$$ , is approximately equal to the wavelength of the particle. That is,  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}x \\approx \\lambda\\)$$ . There is an interesting trade-off between position and momentum. The uncertainty in an electron\u2019s position can be reduced by using a shorter-wavelength electron, since  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}x \\approx \\lambda\\)$$ . But shortening the wavelength increases the uncertainty in momentum, since  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}p \\approx h/\\lambda\\)$$ . Conversely, the uncertainty in momentum can be reduced by using a longer-wavelength electron, but that increases the uncertainty in position. Mathematically, you can express the trade-off by multiplying the uncertainties. The wavelength cancels, leaving\n\n $$\\[\\text{\u0394}x\\text{\u0394}p \\approx h.\\]$$ \n\nTherefore, if one uncertainty is reduced, the other must increase so that their product is  $$\\(\\approx h\\)$$  . With the use of advanced mathematics, Heisenberg showed that the best that can be done in a simultaneous measurement of position and momentum is\n\n$$\\[\\text{\u0394}x\\text{\u0394}p \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}.\\]$$\n\nThat relationship is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.",

Analysis of emission spectra shows that energy is emitted from energized gas in discrete quantities. The Bohr model of the atom describes electrons existing in discrete orbits, with discrete energies emitted and absorbed as the electrons decrease and increase in orbital energy. The energy emitted or absorbed by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined with the equation  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}E = E_{i} - E_{f}\\)$$, where  $$\\(E_{n} = \\frac{Z^{2}}{n^{2}}E_{o}\\left( {n = 1,2,3,...} \\right)\\)$$ . The wavelength of energy absorbed or emitted by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined by the equation  $$\\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R\\left( {\\frac{1}{n_{f}{}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}{}^{2}}} \\right)\\)$$, where  $$\\(R = 1.097\\  \\times \\ 10^{7}\\text{m}^{-1}\\)$$ .

Figure 22.15 shows how the principle applies to the ground state of hydrogen. If you try to follow the electron in some well-defined orbit using a probe that has a wavelength small enough to measure position accurately, you will instead knock the electron out of its orbit. Each measurement of the electron\u2019s position will find it to be in a definite location somewhere near the nucleus. Repeated measurements reveal a cloud of probability like that in the figure, with each speck the location determined by a single measurement. There is not a well-defined, circular-orbit type of distribution. Nature again proves to be different on a small scale than on a macroscopic scale.",

Analysis of emission spectra shows that energy is emitted from energized gas in discrete quantities. The Bohr model of the atom describes electrons existing in discrete orbits, with discrete energies emitted and absorbed as the electrons decrease and increase in orbital energy. The energy emitted or absorbed by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined with the equation  $$\\(\\text{\u0394}E = E_{i} - E_{f}\\)$$, where  $$\\(E_{n} = \\frac{Z^{2}}{n^{2}}E_{o}\\left( {n = 1,2,3,...} \\right)\\)$$ . The wavelength of energy absorbed or emitted by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined by the equation  $$\\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R\\left( {\\frac{1}{n_{f}{}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}{}^{2}}} \\right)\\)$$, where  $$\\(R = 1.097\\  \\times \\ 10^{7}\\text{m}^{-1}\\)$$ . Described as an electron cloud, the quantum model of the atom is the result of de Broglie waves and Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle. ",

However, just when the first direct evidence of atoms was obtained, it became clear that they have a substructure and a tiny nucleus. The nucleus itself has spectacular characteristics. For example, certain nuclei are unstable, and their decay emits radiations with energies millions of times greater than atomic energies. Some of the mysteries of nature, such as why the core of Earth remains molten and how the Sun produces its energy, are explained by nuclear phenomena. The exploration of radioactivity and the nucleus has revealed new fundamental particles, forces, and conservation laws. That exploration has evolved into a search for further underlying structures, such as quarks. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of the nucleus and nuclear radioactivity.",

Atomic numbers and mass numbers are used to differentiate between various atoms and isotopes. Those numbers can be combined into an easily recognizable form called a nuclide. The size and stability of the nucleus is based upon two forces: the electromagnetic force and strong nuclear force. Radioactive decay is the alteration of the nucleus through the emission of particles or energy. Alpha decay occurs when too many protons exist in the nucleus. It results in the ejection of an alpha particle, as described in the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow{}_{Z - 2}^{A - 4}{}_{N} + {}_{}^{}\\text{e}_{}\\)$$ . Beta decay occurs when too many neutrons (or protons) exist in the nucleus. It results in the transmutation of a neutron into a proton, electron, and neutrino. The decay is expressed through the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow{}_{Z + 1}^{}{}_{N - 1} + e + v\\)$$ . (Beta decay may also transform a proton into a neutron.) Gamma decay occurs when a nucleus in an excited state move to a more stable state, resulting in the release of a photon. Gamma decay is represented with the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow X_{N} + \\gamma\\)$$ . The penetration distance of radiation depends on its energy, charge, and type of material it encounters. ",

                    "context": "At this point, you are likely familiar with the neutron and proton, the two fundamental particles that make up the nucleus of an atom. Those two particles, collectively called nucleons, make up the small interior portion of the atom. Both particles have nearly the same mass, although the neutron is about two parts in 1,000 more massive. The mass of a proton is equivalent to 1,836 electrons, while the mass of a neutron is equivalent to that of 1,839 electrons. That said, each of the particles is significantly more massive than the electron.\n\nWhen describing the mass of objects on the scale of nucleons and atoms, it is most reasonable to measure their mass in terms of atoms. The atomic mass unit (u) was originally defined so that a neutral carbon atom would have a mass of exactly 12 u. Given that protons and neutrons are approximately the same mass, that there are six protons and six neutrons in a carbon atom, and that the mass of an electron is minuscule in comparison, measuring this way allows for both protons and neutrons to have masses close to 1 u. Table 22.1 shows the mass of protons, neutrons, and electrons on the new scale. \n\nAnother other useful mass unit on the atomic scale is the  $$\\(\\text{M}\\text{e}\\text{V}/c^{2}\\)$$ . While rarely used in most contexts, it is convenient when one uses the equation  $$\\(E = mc^{2}\\)$$, as will be addressed later in this text.\n\nTo more completely characterize nuclei, let us also consider two other important quantities: the atomic number and the mass number. The atomic number, Z, represents the number of protons within a nucleus. That value determines the elemental quality of each atom. Every carbon atom, for instance, has a Z value of 6, whereas every oxygen atom has a Z value of 8. For clarification, only oxygen atoms may have a Z value of 8. If the Z value is not 8, the atom cannot be oxygen.\n\nThe mass number, A, represents the total number of protons and neutrons, or nucleons, within an atom. For an ordinary carbon atom the mass number would be 12, as there are typically six neutrons accompanying the six protons within the atom. In the case of carbon, the mass would be exactly 12 u. For oxygen, with a mass number of 16, the atomic mass is 15.994915 u. Of course, the difference is minor and can be ignored for most scenarios. Again, because the mass of an electron is so small compared to the nucleons, the mass number and the atomic mass can be essentially equivalent. Figure 22.16 shows an example of Lithium-7, which has an atomic number of 3 and a mass number of 7.\n\nHow does the mass number help to differentiate one atom from another? If each atom of carbon has an atomic number of 6, then what is the value of including the mass number at all? The intent of the mass number is to differentiate between various isotopes of an atom. The term isotope refers to the variation of atoms based upon the number of neutrons within their nucleus. While it is most common for there to be six neutrons accompanying the six protons within a carbon atom, it is possible to find carbon atoms with seven neutrons or eight neutrons. Those carbon atoms are respectively referred to as carbon-13 and carbon-14 atoms, with their mass numbers being their primary distinction. The isotope distinction is an important one to make, as the number of neutrons within an atom can affect a number of its properties, not the least of which is nuclear stability.\n\nTo more easily identify various atoms, their atomic number and mass number are typically written in a form of representation called the nuclide. The nuclide form appears as follows: $$\\({}_{A}^{Z}X{}_{N}\\)$$, where X is the atomic symbol and N represents the number of neutrons. \n\nLet us look at a few examples of nuclides expressed in the  $$\\({}_{A}^{Z}X{}_{N}\\)$$  notation. The nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen, is a single proton, or  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}\\)$$ (the zero for no neutrons is often omitted). To check the symbol, refer to the periodic table\u2014you see that the atomic number Z of hydrogen is 1. Since you are given that there are no neutrons, the mass number A is also 1. There is a scarce form of hydrogen found in nature called deuterium; its nucleus has one proton and one neutron and, hence, twice the mass of common hydrogen. The symbol for deuterium is, thus,  $$\\({}_{1}^{2}\\text{H}{}_{2}\\)$$ . An even rarer\u2014and radioactive\u2014form of hydrogen is called tritium, since it has a single proton and two neutrons, and it is written  $$\\({}_{1}^{3}\\text{H}{}_{2}\\)$$ . The three varieties of hydrogen have nearly identical chemistries, but the nuclei differ greatly in mass, stability, and other characteristics. Again, the different nuclei are referred to as isotopes of the same element.\n\nThere is some redundancy in the symbols A, X, Z, and N. If the element X is known, then Z can be found in a periodic table. If both A and X are known, then N can also be determined by first finding Z; then, N  = A  \u2013 Z. Thus the simpler notation for nuclides is\n\n$$\\[{}^{A}X,\\]$$\n\nwhich is sufficient and is most commonly used. For example, in this simpler notation, the three isotopes of hydrogen are  $$\\({}^{1}\\text{H}\\)$$, $$\\({}^{2}\\text{H}\\)$$, and  $$\\({}^{3}\\text{H}\\)$$ . For $$\\({}^{238}\\text{U}\\)$$, should we need to know, wecan determine that Z = 92 for uranium from the periodic table, and thus, N = 238 \u2212 92 = 146.",

                    "context": "In 1896, the French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852\u20131908) noticed something strange. When a uranium-rich mineral called pitchblende was placed on a completely opaque envelope containing a photographic plate, it darkened spots on the photographic plate.. Becquerel reasoned that the pitchblende must emit invisible rays capable of penetrating the opaque material. Stranger still was that no light was shining on the pitchblende, which means that the pitchblende was emitting the invisible rays continuously without having any energy input! There is an apparent violation of the law of conservation of energy, one that scientists can now explain using Einstein\u2019s famous equation  $$\\(E = mc^{2}\\text{.}\\)$$  It was soon evident that Becquerel\u2019s rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics.\n\nTo this point, most reactions you have studied have been chemical reactions, which are reactions involving the electrons surrounding the atoms. However, two types of experimental evidence implied that Becquerel\u2019s rays did not originate with electrons, but instead within the nucleus of an atom.\n\nFirst, the radiation is found to be only associated with certain elements, such as uranium. Whether uranium was in the form of an element or compound was irrelevant to its radiation. In addition, the presence of radiation does not vary with temperature, pressure, or ionization state of the uranium atom. Since all of those factors affect electrons in an atom, the radiation cannot come from electron transitions, as atomic spectra do.\n\nThe huge energy emitted during each event is the second piece of evidence that the radiation cannot be atomic. Nuclear radiation has energies on the order of 106 eV per event, which is much greater than typical atomic energies that are a few eV, such as those observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high as the most energetic X-rays.\n\nBut why would reactions within the nucleus take place? And what would cause an apparently stable structure to begin emitting energy? Was there something special about Becquerel\u2019s uranium-rich pitchblende? To answer those questions, it is necessary to look into the structure of the nucleus. Though it is perhaps surprising, you will find that many of the same principles that we observe on a macroscopic level still apply to the nucleus.",

                    "context": "A variety of experiments indicate that a nucleus behaves something like a tightly packed ball of nucleons, as illustrated in Figure 22.17. Those nucleons have large kinetic energies and, thus, move rapidly in very close contact. Nucleons can be separated by a large force, such as in a collision with another nucleus, but strongly resist being pushed closer together. The most compelling evidence that nucleons are closely packed in a nucleus is that the radius of a nucleus, r, is found to be approximately\n\n$$\\[r = r_{o}A^{\\frac{1}{3}},\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(r_{o} =\\)$$ 1.2 femtometer (fm) and A is the mass number of the nucleus.\n\nNote that  $$\\(r^{3} \\propto A\\)$$ . Since many nuclei are spherical, and the volume of a sphere is  $$\\(V = \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right)\\pi r^{3}\\)$$, we see that  $$\\(V \\propto A\\)$$ \u2014that is, the volume of a nucleus is proportional to the number of nucleons in it. That is what you expect if you pack nucleons so close that there is no empty space between them.\n\nSo what forces hold a nucleus together? After all, the nucleus is very small and its protons, being positive, should exert tremendous repulsive forces on one another. Considering that, it seems that the nucleus would be forced apart, not together!\n\nThe answer is that a previously unknown force holds the nucleus together and makes it into a tightly packed ball of nucleons. This force is known as the strong nuclear force. The strong force has such a short range that it quickly fall to zero over a distance of only 10\u201315 meters. However, like glue, it is very strong when the nucleons get close to one another.\n\nThe balancing of the electromagnetic force with the nuclear forces is what allows the nucleus to maintain its spherical shape. If, for any reason, the electromagnetic force should overcome the nuclear force, components of the nucleus would be projected outward, creating the very radiation that Becquerel discovered!\n\nUnderstanding why the nucleus would break apart can be partially explained using Table 22.2. The balance between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force is a tenuous one. Recall that the attractive strong nuclear force exists between any two nucleons and acts over a very short range while the weaker repulsive electromagnetic force only acts between protons, although over a larger range. Considering the interactions, an imperfect balance between neutrons and protons can result in a nuclear reaction, with the result of regaining equilibrium.\n\nThe radiation discovered by Becquerel was due to the large number of protons present in his uranium-rich pitchblende. In short, the large number of protons caused the electromagnetic force to be greater than the strong nuclear force. To regain stability, the nucleus needed to undergo a nuclear reaction called alpha (\u03b1) decay.",

Atomic numbers and mass numbers are used to differentiate between various atoms and isotopes. Those numbers can be combined into an easily recognizable form called a nuclide. The size and stability of the nucleus is based upon two forces: the electromagnetic force and strong nuclear force. Radioactive decay is the alteration of the nucleus through the emission of particles or energy. Alpha decay occurs when too many protons exist in the nucleus. It results in the ejection of an alpha particle, as described in the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow{}_{Z - 2}^{A - 4}{}_{N} + {}_{}^{}\\text{e}_{}\\)$$ . Beta decay occurs when too many neutrons (or protons) exist in the nucleus. It results in the transmutation of a neutron into a proton, electron, and neutrino. The decay is expressed through the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow{}_{Z + 1}^{}{}_{N - 1} + e + v\\)$$ . (Beta decay may also transform a proton into a neutron.) Gamma decay occurs when a nucleus in an excited state move to a more stable state, resulting in the release of a photon. Gamma decay is represented with the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow X_{N} + \\gamma\\)$$ . The penetration distance of radiation depends on its energy, charge, and type of material it encounters. ",

Atomic numbers and mass numbers are used to differentiate between various atoms and isotopes. Those numbers can be combined into an easily recognizable form called a nuclide. The size and stability of the nucleus is based upon two forces: the electromagnetic force and strong nuclear force. Radioactive decay is the alteration of the nucleus through the emission of particles or energy. Alpha decay occurs when too many protons exist in the nucleus. It results in the ejection of an alpha particle, as described in the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow{}_{Z - 2}^{A - 4}{}_{N} + {}_{}^{}\\text{e}_{}\\)$$ . Beta decay occurs when too many neutrons (or protons) exist in the nucleus. It results in the transmutation of a neutron into a proton, electron, and neutrino. The decay is expressed through the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow{}_{Z + 1}^{}{}_{N - 1} + e + v\\)$$ . (Beta decay may also transform a proton into a neutron.) Gamma decay occurs when a nucleus in an excited state move to a more stable state, resulting in the release of a photon. Gamma decay is represented with the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow X_{N} + \\gamma\\)$$ . The penetration distance of radiation depends on its energy, charge, and type of material it encounters. ",

It is the most common type of decay and causes the nucleus to regain equilibrium between its two competing internal forces. During alpha decay, the nucleus ejects two protons and two neutrons, allowing the strong nuclear force to regain balance with the repulsive electromagnetic force. The nuclear equation for an alpha decay process can be shown as follows.\n\n$$\\[{}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow{}_{Z - 2}^{A - 4}{}_{N} + {}_{}^{}\\text{e}_{}\\]$$\n\nThree things to note as a result of the above equation:\n\nBy ejecting an alpha particle, the original nuclide decreases in atomic number. That means that Becquerel\u2019s uranium nucleus, upon decaying, is actually transformed into thorium, two atomic numbers lower on the periodic table! The process of changing elemental composition is called transmutation. Note that the two protons and two neutrons ejected from the nucleus combine to form a helium nucleus. Shortly after decay, the ejected helium ion typically acquires two electrons to become a stable helium atom. Finally, it is important to see that, despite the elemental change, physical conservation still takes place. The mass number of the new element and the alpha particle together equal the mass number of the original element. Also, the net charge of all particles involved remains the same before and after the transmutation. ",

Atomic numbers and mass numbers are used to differentiate between various atoms and isotopes. Those numbers can be combined into an easily recognizable form called a nuclide. The size and stability of the nucleus is based upon two forces: the electromagnetic force and strong nuclear force. Radioactive decay is the alteration of the nucleus through the emission of particles or energy. Alpha decay occurs when too many protons exist in the nucleus. It results in the ejection of an alpha particle, as described in the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow{}_{Z - 2}^{A - 4}{}_{N} + {}_{}^{}\\text{e}_{}\\)$$ . Beta decay occurs when too many neutrons (or protons) exist in the nucleus. It results in the transmutation of a neutron into a proton, electron, and neutrino. The decay is expressed through the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow{}_{Z + 1}^{}{}_{N - 1} + e + v\\)$$ . (Beta decay may also transform a proton into a neutron.) Gamma decay occurs when a nucleus in an excited state move to a more stable state, resulting in the release of a photon. Gamma decay is represented with the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow X_{N} + \\gamma\\)$$ . The penetration distance of radiation depends on its energy, charge, and type of material it encounters. ",

Beta particles, with one electron, carry a net charge of \u20131. Meanwhile, gamma rays are solely photons, or light, and carry no charge. The difference in charge plays an important role in how the three radiations affect surrounding substances.\n\nAlpha particles, being highly charged, will quickly interact with ions in the air and electrons within metals. As a result, they have a short range and short penetrating distance in most materials. Beta particles, being slightly less charged, have a larger range and larger penetrating distance. Gamma rays, on the other hand, have little electric interaction with particles and travel much farther. Two diagrams below show the importance of difference in penetration. Table 22.3 shows the distance of radiation penetration, and Figure 22.21 shows the influence various factors have on radiation penetration distance.",

Atomic numbers and mass numbers are used to differentiate between various atoms and isotopes. Those numbers can be combined into an easily recognizable form called a nuclide. The size and stability of the nucleus is based upon two forces: the electromagnetic force and strong nuclear force. Radioactive decay is the alteration of the nucleus through the emission of particles or energy. Alpha decay occurs when too many protons exist in the nucleus. It results in the ejection of an alpha particle, as described in the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow{}_{Z - 2}^{A - 4}{}_{N} + {}_{}^{}\\text{e}_{}\\)$$ . Beta decay occurs when too many neutrons (or protons) exist in the nucleus. It results in the transmutation of a neutron into a proton, electron, and neutrino. The decay is expressed through the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow{}_{Z + 1}^{}{}_{N - 1} + e + v\\)$$ . (Beta decay may also transform a proton into a neutron.) Gamma decay occurs when a nucleus in an excited state move to a more stable state, resulting in the release of a photon. Gamma decay is represented with the equation  $$\\({}_{}^{}{}_{N}\\rightarrow X_{N} + \\gamma\\)$$ . The penetration distance of radiation depends on its energy, charge, and type of material it encounters. ",

For example, radium and polonium, discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie, decay faster than uranium. That means they have shorter lifetimes, producing a greater rate of decay. Here we will explore half-life and activity, the quantitative terms for lifetime and rate of decay.\n\nWhy do we use the term like half-life rather than lifetime? The answer can be found by examining Figure 22.24, which shows how the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample decreases with time. The time in which half of the original number of nuclei decay is defined as the half-life,  $$\\(t_{\\frac{1}{2}}\\)$$ . After one half-life passes, half of the remaining nuclei will decay in the next half-life. Then, half of that amount in turn decays in the following half-life. Therefore, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases from N to N / 2 in one half-life, to N / 4 in the next, to N / 8 in the next, and so on. Nuclear decay is an example of a purely statistical process.\n\nThe following equation gives the quantitative relationship between the original number of nuclei present at time zero  $$\\(\\left( N_{O} \\right)\\)$$  and the number  $$\\((N)\\)$$  at a later time t\n\n$$\\[N = N_{O}e^{- \\lambda t},\\]$$\n\nwhere e = 2.71828... is the base of the natural logarithm, and  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$  is the decay constant for the nuclide. The shorter the half-life, the larger is the value of  $$\\(\\lambda\\)$$, and the faster the exponential  $$\\(e^{- \\lambda t}\\)$$  decreases with time. The decay constant can be found with the equation\n\n$$\\[\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} \\approx \\frac{0.693}{t_{1/2}}\\text{.}\\]$$",

                    "context": "Radioactive dating or radiometric dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity. Its most familiar application is carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 is an isotope of carbon that is produced when solar neutrinos strike  $$\\({}^{14}\\text{N}\\)$$  particles within the atmosphere. Radioactive carbon has the same chemistry as stable carbon, and so it mixes into the biosphere, where it is consumed and becomes part of every living organism. Carbon-14 has an abundance of 1.3 parts per trillion of normal carbon, so if you know the number of carbon nuclei in an object (perhaps determined by mass and Avogadro\u2019s number), you can multiply that number by  $$\\(1.3\\  \\times \\ 10^{- 12}\\)$$  to find the number of  $$\\({}^{14}\\text{C}\\)$$  nuclei within the object. Over time, carbon-14 will naturally decay back to  $$\\({}^{14}\\text{N}\\)$$  with a half-life of 5,730 years (note that this is an example of beta decay). When an organism dies, carbon exchange with the environment ceases, and  $$\\({}^{14}\\text{C}\\)$$  is not replenished. By comparing the abundance of  $$\\({}^{14}\\text{C}\\)$$  in an artifact, such as mummy wrappings, with the normal abundance in living tissue, it is possible to determine the artifact\u2019s age (or time since death). Carbon-14 dating can be used for biological tissues as old as 50 or 60 thousand years, but is most accurate for younger samples, since the abundance of  $$\\({}^{14}\\text{C}\\)$$  nuclei in them is greater.\n\nOne of the most famous cases of carbon-14 dating involves the Shroud of Turin, a long piece of fabric purported to be the burial shroud of Jesus (see Figure 22.25). This relic was first displayed in Turin in 1354 and was denounced as a fraud at that time by a French bishop. Its remarkable negative imprint of an apparently crucified body resembles the then-accepted image of Jesus. As a result, the relic has been remained controversial throughout the centuries. Carbon-14 dating was not performed on the shroud until 1988, when the process had been refined to the point where only a small amount of material needed to be destroyed. Samples were tested at three independent laboratories, each being given four pieces of cloth, with only one unidentified piece from the shroud, to avoid prejudice. All three laboratories found samples of the shroud contain 92 percent of the  $$\\({}^{14}\\text{C}\\)$$  found in living tissues, allowing the shroud to be dated (see How Old is the Shroud of Turin?).",

The rate of radioactive decay is defined as the sample\u2019s activity, represented by the equation  $$\\(R = \\frac{\\text{\u0394}N}{\\text{\u0394}t}\\)$$ . Knowing the half-life of a radioactive isotope allows for the process of radioactive dating to determine the age of a material. If the half-life of a material is known, the age of the material can be found using the equation  $$\\(N = N_{O}e^{- \\lambda t}\\)$$ . The age of organic material can be determined using the decay of the carbon-14 isotope, while the age of rocks can be determined using the decay of uranium-238. ",

Knowing that energy can be emitted in various forms of nuclear change, is it possible to create a nuclear reaction through our own intervention? The answer to this question is yes. Through two distinct methods, humankind has discovered multiple ways of manipulating the atom to release its internal energy.",

The amount of energy released can be determined through the equation  $$\\(E = mc^{2}\\)$$ . Nuclear fusion is the combining, or fusing together, of two nuclei. Energy is also released in nuclear fusion as the combined nuclei are closer together, resulting in a decreased strong nuclear force. Fission was used in two nuclear weapons at the conclusion of World War II: the gun-type uranium bomb and the implosion-type plutonium bomb. While fission has been used in both nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, fusion is capable of releasing more energy per reaction. As a result, fusion is a well-researched, if not yet well-controlled, energy source. ",

                    "context": "In simplest terms, nuclear fission is the splitting of an atomic bond. Given that it requires great energy separate two nucleons, it may come as a surprise to learn that splitting a nucleus can release vast potential energy. And although it is true that huge amounts of energy can be released, considerable effort is needed to do so in practice.\n\nAn unstable atom will naturally decay, but it may take millions of years to do so. As a result, a physical catalyst is necessary to produce useful energy through nuclear fission. The catalyst typically occurs in the form of a free neutron, projected directly at the nucleus of a high-mass atom.\n\nAs shown in Figure 22.26, a neutron strike can cause the nucleus to elongate, much like a drop of liquid water. This is why the model is known as the liquid drop model. As the nucleus elongates, nucleons are no longer so tightly packed, and the repulsive electromagnetic force can overcome the short-range strong nuclear force. The imbalance of forces can result in the two ends of the drop flying apart, with some of the nuclear binding energy released to the surroundings.\n\nAs you can imagine, the consequences of the nuclei splitting are substantial. When a nucleus is split, it is not only energy that is released, but a small number of neutrons as well. Those neutrons have the potential to cause further fission in other nuclei, especially if they are directed back toward the other nuclei by a dense shield or neutron reflector (see part (d) of Figure 22.26).\n\nHowever, not every neutron produced by fission induces further fission. Some neutrons escape the fissionable material, while others interact with a nucleus without making it split. We can enhance the number of fissions produced by neutrons by having a large amount of fissionable material as well as a neutron reflector. The minimum amount necessary for self-sustained fission of a given nuclide is called its critical mass. Some nuclides, such as 239Pu, produce more neutrons per fission than others, such as 235U. Additionally, some nuclides are easier to make fission than others. In particular, 235U and 239Pu are easier to fission than the much more abundant 238U. Both factors affect critical mass, which is smallest for 239Pu. The self-sustained fission of nuclei is commonly referred to as a chain reaction, as shown in Figure 22.27.\n\nA chain reaction can have runaway results. If each atomic split results in two nuclei producing a new fission, the number of nuclear reactions will increase exponentially. One fission will produce two atoms, the next round of fission will create four atoms, the third round eight atoms, and so on. Of course, each time fission occurs, more energy will be emitted, further increasing the power of the atomic reaction. And that is just if two neutrons create fission reactions each round. Perhaps you can now see why so many people consider atomic energy to be an exciting energy source!\n\nTo make a self-sustained nuclear fission reactor with 235U, it is necessary to slow down the neutrons. Water is very effective at this, since neutrons collide with protons in water molecules and lose energy. Figure 22.28 shows a schematic of a reactor design called the pressurized water reactor.\n\nControl rods containing nuclides that very strongly absorb neutrons are used to adjust neutron flux. To produce large amounts of power, reactors contain hundreds to thousands of critical masses, and the chain reaction easily becomes self-sustaining. Neutron flux must be carefully regulated to avoid an out-of-control exponential increase in the rate of fission.\n\nControl rods help prevent overheating, perhaps even a meltdown or explosive disassembly. The water that is used to slow down neutrons, necessary to get them to induce fission in 235U, and achieve criticality, provides a negative feedback for temperature increase. In case the reactor overheats and boils the water to steam or is breached, the absence of water kills the chain reaction. Considerable heat, however, can still be generated by the reactor\u2019s radioactive fission products. Other safety features, thus, need to be incorporated in the event of a loss of coolant accident, including auxiliary cooling water and pumps.",

                    "context": "Nuclear fusion is defined as the combining, or fusing, of two nuclei and, the combining of nuclei also results in an emission of energy. For many, the concept is counterintuitive. After all, if energy is released when a nucleus is split, how can it also be released when nucleons are combined together? The difference between fission and fusion, which results from the size of the nuclei involved, will be addressed next.\n\nRemember that the structure of a nucleus is based on the interplay of the compressive nuclear strong force and the repulsive electromagnetic force. For nuclei that are less massive than iron, the nuclear force is actually stronger than that of the Coulomb force. As a result, when a low-mass nucleus absorbs nucleons, the added neutrons and protons bind the nucleus more tightly. The increased nuclear strong force does work on the nucleus, and energy is released.\n\nOnce the size of the created nucleus exceeds that of iron, the short-ranging nuclear force does not have the ability to bind a nucleus more tightly, and the emission of energy ceases. In fact, for fusion to occur for elements of greater mass than iron, energy must be added to the system! Figure 22.29 shows an energy-mass curve commonly used to describe nuclear reactions. Notice the location of iron (Fe) on the graph. All low-mass nuclei to the left of iron release energy through fusion, while all high-mass particles to the right of iron produce energy through fission.\n\nThe major obstruction to fusion is the Coulomb repulsion force between nuclei. Since the attractive nuclear force that can fuse nuclei together is short ranged, the repulsion of like positive charges must be overcome in order to get nuclei close enough to induce fusion. Figure 22.30 shows an approximate graph of the potential energy between two nuclei as a function of the distance between their centers. The graph resembles a hill with a well in its center. A ball rolled to the left must have enough kinetic energy to get over the hump before it falls into the deeper well with a net gain in energy. So it is with fusion. If the nuclei are given enough kinetic energy to overcome the electric potential energy due to repulsion, then they can combine, release energy, and fall into a deep well. One way to accomplish that end is to heat fusion fuel to high temperatures so that the kinetic energy of thermal motion is sufficient to get the nuclei together.\n\nYou might think that, in our Sun, nuclei are constantly coming into contact and fusing. However, this is only partially true. Only at the Sun\u2019s core are the particles close enough and the temperature high enough for fusion to occur!\n\nIn the series of reactions below, the Sun produces energy by fusing protons, or hydrogen nuclei ( $$\\({}^{1}\\text{H}\\)$$, by far the Sun\u2019s most abundant nuclide) into helium nuclei  $$\\({}^{4}\\text{H}\\text{e}\\)$$ . The principal sequence of fusion reactions forms what is called the proton-proton cycle\n\n$$\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\n{{}^{1}\\text{H} +^{1}\\text{H}\\rightarrow^{2}\\text{H} + e^{+} + v_{e}} & \\left( {0.42\\;\\text{~MeV}} \\right) \\\\\n{{}^{1}\\text{H} +^{2}\\text{H}\\rightarrow^{3}\\text{He} + \\gamma} & \\left( {5.49\\;\\text{~MeV}} \\right) \\\\\n{{}^{3}\\text{He} +^{3}\\text{He}\\rightarrow^{4}\\text{He} +^{1}\\text{H} +^{1}\\text{H}} & {\\left( {12.86\\;\\text{~MeV}} \\right),} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]$$\n\nwhere  $$\\(e^{+}\\)$$  stands for a positron and  $$\\(v_{e}\\)$$  is an electron neutrino. The energy in parentheses is released by the reaction. Note that the first two reactions must occur twice for the third to be possible, so the cycle consumes six protons ( $$\\({}^{1}\\text{H}\\)$$ ) but gives back two. Furthermore, the two positrons produced will find two electrons and annihilate to form four more  $$\\(\\gamma\\)$$  rays, for a total of six. The overall cycle is thus\n\n $$\\[\\begin{matrix}\n{2e - + 4^{1}\\text{H}\\rightarrow 4\\;\\text{H}\\text{e} + 2v_{e} + 6\\gamma} & {\\left( {26.7\\;\\text{~MeV}} \\right),} \\\\\n\\end{matrix}\\]$$\n\nwhere the 26.7 MeV includes the annihilation energy of the positrons and electrons and is distributed among all the reaction products. The solar interior is dense, and the reactions occur deep in the Sun where temperatures are highest. It takes about 32,000 years for the energy to diffuse to the surface and radiate away. However, the neutrinos can carry their energy out of the Sun in less than two seconds, because they interact so weakly with other matter. Negative feedback in the Sun acts as a thermostat to regulate the overall energy output. For instance, if the interior of the Sun becomes hotter than normal, the reaction rate increases, producing energy that expands the interior. The expansion cools it and lowers the reaction rate. Conversely, if the interior becomes too cool, it contracts, increasing the temperature and therefore the reaction rate (see Figure 22.31). Stars like the Sun are stable for billions of years, until a significant fraction of their hydrogen has been depleted.",

The amount of energy released can be determined through the equation  $$\\(E = mc^{2}\\)$$ . Nuclear fusion is the combining, or fusing together, of two nuclei. Energy is also released in nuclear fusion as the combined nuclei are closer together, resulting in a decreased strong nuclear force. Fission was used in two nuclear weapons at the conclusion of World War II: the gun-type uranium bomb and the implosion-type plutonium bomb. While fission has been used in both nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, fusion is capable of releasing more energy per reaction. As a result, fusion is a well-researched, if not yet well-controlled, energy source. ",

                    "context": "The world was in political turmoil when fission was discovered in 1938. Compounding the troubles, the possibility of a self-sustained chain reaction was immediately recognized by leading scientists the world over. The enormous energy known to be in nuclei, but considered inaccessible, now seemed to be available on a large scale.\n\nWithin months after the announcement of the discovery of fission, Adolf Hitler banned the export of uranium from newly occupied Czechoslovakia. It seemed that the possible military value of uranium had been recognized in Nazi Germany, and that a serious effort to build a nuclear bomb had begun.\n\nAlarmed scientists, many of whom fled Nazi Germany, decided to take action. None was more famous or revered than Einstein. It was felt that his help was needed to get the American government to make a serious effort at constructing nuclear weapons as a matter of survival. Leo Szilard, a Hungarian physicist who had emigrated to America, took a draft of a letter to Einstein, who, although a pacifist, signed the final version. The letter was for President Franklin Roosevelt, warning of the German potential to build extremely powerful bombs of a new type. It was sent in August of 1939, just before the German invasion of Poland that marked the start of World War II.\n\nIt was not until December 6, 1941, the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, that the United States made a massive commitment to building a nuclear bomb. The top secret Manhattan Project was a crash program aimed at beating the Germans. It was carried out in remote locations, such as Los Alamos, New Mexico, whenever possible, and eventually came to cost billions of dollars and employ the efforts of more than 100,000 people. J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904\u20131967), a talented physicist, was chosen to head the project. The first major step was made by Enrico Fermi and his group in December 1942, when they completed the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor. This first atomic pile, built in a squash court at the University of Chicago, proved that a fission chain reaction was possible.\n\nPlutonium was recognized as easier to fission with neutrons and, hence, a superior fission material very early in the Manhattan Project. Plutonium availability was uncertain, and so a uranium bomb was developed simultaneously. Figure 22.32 shows a gun-type bomb, which takes two subcritical uranium masses and shoots them together. To get an appreciable yield, the critical mass must be held together by the explosive charges inside the cannon barrel for a few microseconds. Since the buildup of the uranium chain reaction is relatively slow, the device to bring the critical mass together can be relatively simple. Owing to the fact that the rate of spontaneous fission is low, a neutron source is at the center the assembled critical mass.\n\nPlutonium\u2019s special properties necessitated a more sophisticated critical mass assembly, shown schematically in Figure 22.33. A spherical mass of plutonium is surrounded by shaped charges (high explosives that focus their blast) that implode the plutonium, crushing it into a smaller volume to form a critical mass. The implosion technique is faster and more effective, because it compresses three-dimensionally rather than one-dimensionally as in the gun-type bomb. Again, a neutron source is included to initiate the chain reaction.\n\nOwing to its complexity, the plutonium bomb needed to be tested before there could be any attempt to use it. On July 16, 1945, the test named Trinity was conducted in the isolated Alamogordo Desert in New Mexico, about 200 miles south of Los Alamos (see Figure 22.34). A new age had begun. The yield of the Trinity device was about 10 kilotons (kT), the equivalent of 5,000 of the largest conventional bombs.\n\nAlthough Germany surrendered on May 7, 1945, Japan had been steadfastly refusing to surrender for many months, resulting large numbers of civilian and military casualties. Invasion plans by the Allies estimated a million casualties of their own and untold losses of Japanese lives. The bomb was viewed as a way to end the war. The first bomb used was a gun-type uranium bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6 by the United States. Its yield of about 15 kT destroyed the city and killed an estimated 80,000 people, with 100,000 more being seriously injured. The second bomb was an implosion-type plutonium bomb dropped on Nagasaki only three days later. Its 20-kT yield killed at least 50,000 people, something less than Hiroshima because of the hilly terrain and the fact that it was a few kilometers off target. The Japanese were told that one bomb a week would be dropped until they surrendered unconditionally, which they did on August 14. In actuality, the United States had only enough plutonium for one more bomb, as yet unassembled.\n\nKnowing that fusion produces several times more energy per kilogram of fuel than fission, some scientists pursued the idea of constructing a fusion bomb. The first such bomb was detonated by the United States several years after the first fission bombs, on October 31, 1952, at Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. It had a yield of 10 megatons (MT), about 670 times that of the fission bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The Soviet Union followed with a fusion device of its own in August 1953, and a weapons race, beyond the aim of this text to discuss, continued until the end of the Cold War.\n\nFigure 22.35 shows a simple diagram of how a thermonuclear bomb is constructed. A fission bomb is exploded next to fusion fuel in the solid form of lithium deuteride. Before the shock wave blows it apart,  $$\\(\\gamma\\)$$  rays heat and compress the fuel, and neutrons create tritium through the reaction  $$\\(n +^{6}\\text{L}\\text{i}\\rightarrow^{3}\\text{H} +^{4}\\text{H}\\text{e}\\)$$ . Additional fusion and fission fuels are enclosed in a dense shell of  $$\\({}^{238}\\text{U}\\)$$ . At the same time that the uranium shell reflects the neutrons back into the fuel to enhance its fusion, the fast-moving neutrons cause the plentiful and inexpensive  $$\\({}^{238}\\text{U}\\)$$  to fission, part of what allows thermonuclear bombs to be so large.\n\nOf course, not all applications of nuclear physics are as destructive as the weapons described above. Hundreds of nuclear fission power plants around the world attest to the fact that controlled fission is both practical and economical. Given growing concerns over global warming, nuclear power is often seen as a viable alternative to energy derived from fossil fuels.",

The amount of energy released can be determined through the equation  $$\\(E = mc^{2}\\)$$ . Nuclear fusion is the combining, or fusing together, of two nuclei. Energy is also released in nuclear fusion as the combined nuclei are closer together, resulting in a decreased strong nuclear force. Fission was used in two nuclear weapons at the conclusion of World War II: the gun-type uranium bomb and the implosion-type plutonium bomb. While fission has been used in both nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, fusion is capable of releasing more energy per reaction. As a result, fusion is a well-researched, if not yet well-controlled, energy source. ",

                    "context": "A host of medical imaging techniques employ nuclear radiation. What makes nuclear radiation so useful? First,  $$\\(\\gamma\\)$$  radiation can easily penetrate tissue; hence, it is a useful probe to monitor conditions inside the body. Second, nuclear radiation depends on the nuclide and not on the chemical compound it is in, so that a radioactive nuclide can be put into a compound designed for specific purposes. When that is done, the compound is said to be tagged. A tagged compound used for medical purposes is called a radiopharmaceutical. Radiation detectors external to the body can determine the location and concentration of a radiopharmaceutical to yield medically useful information. For example, certain drugs are concentrated in inflamed regions of the body, and their locations can aid diagnosis and treatment as seen in Figure 22.37. Another application utilizes a radiopharmaceutical that the body sends to bone cells, particularly those that are most active, to detect cancerous tumors or healing points. Images can then be produced of such bone scans. Clever use of radioisotopes determines the functioning of body organs, such as blood flow, heart muscle activity, and iodine uptake in the thyroid gland. For instance, a radioactive form of iodine can be used to monitor the thyroid, a radioactive thallium salt can be used to follow the blood stream, and radioactive gallium can be used for cancer imaging.\n\nOnce a radioactive compound has been ingested, a device like that shown in Figure 22.38 is used to monitor nuclear activity. The device, called an Anger camera or gamma camera uses a piece of lead with holes bored through it. The gamma rays are redirected through the collimator to narrow their beam, and are then interpreted using a device called a scintillator. The computer analysis of detector signals produces an image. One of the disadvantages of this detection method is that there is no depth information (i.e., it provides a two-dimensional view of the tumor as opposed to a three-dimensional view), because radiation from any location under that detector produces a signal.\n\nSingle-photon-emission computer tomography (SPECT) used in conjunction with a CT scanner improves on the process carried out by the gamma camera. Figure 22.39 shows a patient in a circular array of SPECT detectors that may be stationary or rotated, with detector output used by a computer to construct a detailed image. The spatial resolution of this technique is poor, but the three-dimensional image created results in a marked improvement in contrast.\n\nPositron emission tomography (or PET) scans utilize images produced by  $$\\(\\beta^{+}\\)$$  emitters. When the emitted positron \u03b2+ encounters an electron, mutual annihilation occurs, producing two \u03b3 rays. Those  $$\\(\\gamma\\)$$  rays have identical 0.511 MeV energies (the energy comes from the destruction of an electron or positron mass) and they move directly away from each other, allowing detectors to determine their point of origin accurately (as shown in Figure 22.40). It requires detectors on opposite sides to simultaneously (i.e., at the same time) detect photons of 0.511 MeV energy and utilizes computer imaging techniques similar to those in SPECT and CT scans. PET is used extensively for diagnosing brain disorders. It can note decreased metabolism in certain regions that accompany Alzheimer\u2019s disease. PET can also locate regions in the brain that become active when a person carries out specific activities, such as speaking, closing his or her eyes, and so on.",

It can cause cancer, burns, and hair loss, and yet it is used to treat and even cure cancer. How do we understand such effects? Once again, there is an underlying simplicity in nature, even in complicated biological organisms. All the effects of ionizing radiation on biological tissue can be understood by knowing that ionizing radiation affects molecules within cells, particularly DNA molecules. Let us take a brief look at molecules within cells and how cells operate. Cells have long, double-helical DNA molecules containing chemical patterns called genetic codes that govern the function and processes undertaken by the cells. Damage to DNA consists of breaks in chemical bonds or other changes in the structural features of the DNA chain, leading to changes in the genetic code. In human cells, we can have as many as a million individual instances of damage to DNA per cell per day. The repair ability of DNA is vital for maintaining the integrity of the genetic code and for the normal functioning of the entire organism. A cell with a damaged ability to repair DNA, which could have been induced by ionizing radiation, can do one of the following:\n\nThe cell can go into an irreversible state of dormancy, known as senescence. The cell can commit suicide, known as programmed cell death. The cell can go into unregulated cell division, leading to tumors and cancers. \n\nSince ionizing radiation damages the DNA, ionizing radiation has its greatest effect on cells that rapidly reproduce, including most types of cancer. Thus, cancer cells are more sensitive to radiation than normal cells and can be killed by it easily. Cancer is characterized by a malfunction of cell reproduction, and can also be caused by ionizing radiation. There is no contradiction to say that ionizing radiation can be both a cure and a cause.",

The central problem in radiotherapy is to make the dose for cancer cells as high as possible while limiting the dose for normal cells. The ratio of abnormal cells killed to normal cells killed is called the therapeutic ratio, and all radiotherapy techniques are designed to enhance that ratio. Radiation can be concentrated in cancerous tissue by a number of techniques. One of the most prevalent techniques for well-defined tumors is a geometric technique shown in Figure 22.41. A narrow beam of radiation is passed through the patient from a variety of directions with a common crossing point in the tumor. The technique concentrates the dose in the tumor while spreading it out over a large volume of normal tissue.\n\nAnother use of radiation therapy is through radiopharmaceuticals. Cleverly, radiopharmaceuticals are used in cancer therapy by tagging antibodies with radioisotopes. Those antibodies are extracted from the patient, cultured, loaded with a radioisotope, and then returned to the patient. The antibodies are then concentrated almost entirely in the tissue they developed to fight, thus localizing the radiation in abnormal tissue. This method is used with radioactive iodine to fight thyroid cancer. While the therapeutic ratio can be quite high for such short-range radiation, there can be a significant dose for organs that eliminate radiopharmaceuticals from the body, such as the liver, kidneys, and bladder. As with most radiotherapy, the technique is limited by the tolerable amount of damage to the normal tissue.",

                    "context": "To quantitatively discuss the biological effects of ionizing radiation, we need a radiation dose unit that is directly related to those effects. To do define such a unit, it is important to consider both the biological organism and the radiation itself. Knowing that the amount of ionization is proportional to the amount of deposited energy, we define a radiation dose unit called the rad. It 1/100 of a joule of ionizing energy deposited per kilogram of tissue, which is\n\n$$\\[1\\;\\text{rad} = 0.01\\;\\text{J}/\\text{kg}.\\]$$\n\nFor example, if a 50.0-kg person is exposed to ionizing radiation over her entire body and she absorbs 1.00 J, then her whole-body radiation dose is\n\n$$\\[\\left( {1.00\\;\\text{J}} \\right)/(50.0\\;\\text{kg}) = 0.0200\\;\\text{J}/\\text{kg} = 2.00\\;\\text{rad}.\\]$$\n\nIf the same 1.00 J of ionizing energy were absorbed in her 2.00-kg forearm alone, then the dose to the forearm would be\n\n$$\\[\\left( {1.00\\;\\text{J}} \\right)/(2.00\\;\\text{kg}) = 0.500\\;\\text{J}/\\text{kg} = 50.0\\;\\text{rad},\\]$$\n\nand the unaffected tissue would have a zero rad dose. When calculating radiation doses, you divide the energy absorbed by the mass of affected tissue. You must specify the affected region, such as the whole body or forearm in addition to giving the numerical dose in rads. Although the energy per kilogram in 1 rad is small, it can still have significant effects. Since only a few eV cause ionization, just 0.01 J of ionizing energy can create a huge number of ion pairs and have an effect at the cellular level.\n\nThe effects of ionizing radiation may be directly proportional to the dose in rads, but they also depend on the type of radiation and the type of tissue. That is, for a given dose in rads, the effects depend on whether the radiation is  $$\\(\\alpha\\)$$,  $$\\(\\beta\\)$$,  $$\\(\\gamma\\)$$, X-ray, or some other type of ionizing radiation. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) relates to the amount of biological damage that can occur from a given type of radiation and is given in Table 22.4 for several types of ionizing radiation.\n\nA final dose unit more closely related to the effect of radiation on biological tissue is called the roentgen equivalent man, or rem. A combination of all factors mentioned previously, the roentgen equivalent man is defined to be the dose in rads multiplied by the relative biological effectiveness.\n\n$$\\[\\text{rem} = \\text{rad}\\  \\times \\ \\text{RBE}\\]$$\n\nThe large-scale effects of radiation on humans can be divided into two categories: immediate effects and long-term effects. Table 22.5 gives the immediate effects of whole-body exposures received in less than one day. If the radiation exposure is spread out over more time, greater doses are needed to cause the effects listed. Any dose less than 10 rem is called a low dose, a dose 10 to 100 rem is called a moderate dose, and anything greater than 100 rem is called a high dose.",

                {
                    "context": "The gravitational force is most familiar to us because it describes so many of our common observations. It explains why a dropped ball falls to the ground and why our planet orbits the Sun. It gives us the property of weight and determines much about the motion of objects in our daily lives. Because gravitational force acts between all objects of mass and has the ability to act over large distances, the gravitational force can be used to explain much of what we observe and can even describe the motion of objects on astronomical scales! That said, gravity is incredibly weak compared to the other fundamental forces and is the weakest of all of the fundamental forces. Consider this: The entire mass of Earth is needed to hold an iron nail to the ground. Yet with a simple magnet, the force of gravity can be overcome, allowing the nail to accelerate upward through space.\n\nThe electromagnetic force is responsible for both electrostatic interactions and the magnetic force seen between bar magnets. When focusing on the electrostatic relationship between two charged particles, the electromagnetic force is known as the coulomb force. The electromagnetic force is an important force in the chemical and biological sciences, as it is responsible for molecular connections like ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the electromagnetic force is behind the common physics forces of friction and the normal force. Like the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force is an inverse square law. However, the electromagnetic force does not exist between any two objects of mass, only those that are charged.\n\nWhen considering the structure of an atom, the electromagnetic force is somewhat apparent. After all, the electrons are held in place by an attractive force from the nucleus. But what causes the nucleus to remain intact? After all, if all protons are positive, it makes sense that the coulomb force between the protons would repel the nucleus apart immediately. Scientists theorized that another force must exist within the nucleus to keep it together. They further theorized that this nuclear force must be significantly stronger than gravity, which has been observed and measured for centuries, and also stronger than the electromagnetic force, which would cause the protons to want to accelerate away from each other.\n\nThe strong nuclear force is an attractive force that exists between all nucleons. This force, which acts equally between proton-proton connections, proton-neutron connections, and neutron-neutron connections, is the strongest of all forces at short ranges. However, at a distance of 10\u201313 cm, or the diameter of a single proton, the force dissipates to zero. If the nucleus is large (it has many nucleons), then the distance between each nucleon could be much larger than the diameter of a single proton.\n\nThe weak nuclear force is responsible for beta decay, as seen in the equation  $$\\[{}_{Z}^{A}X_{N}\\operatorname{~\\rightarrow~}\\ ~_{Z + 1}^{A}Y_{N\u20131}~ + ~e~ + ~v.\\]$$  Recall that beta decay is when a beta particle is ejected from an atom. In order to accelerate away from the nucleus, the particle must be acted on by a force. Enrico Fermi was the first to envision this type of force. While this force is appropriately labeled, it remains stronger than the gravitational force. However, its range is even smaller than that of the strong force, as can be seen in Table 23.1. The weak nuclear force is more important than it may appear at this time, as will be addressed when we discuss quarks.",

                    "context": "Just as it troubled Einstein prior to formulating the gravitational field theory, the concept of forces acting over a distance had greatly troubled particle physicists. That is, how does one proton know that another exists? Furthermore, what causes one proton to make a second proton repel? Or, for that matter, what is it about a proton that causes a neutron to attract? These mysterious interactions were first considered by Hideki Yukawa in 1935 and laid the foundation for much of what we now understand about particle physics.\n\nHideki Yukawa\u2019s focus was on the strong nuclear force and, in particular, its incredibly short range. His idea was a blend of particles, relativity, and quantum mechanics that was applicable to all four forces. Yukawa proposed that the nuclear force is actually transmitted by the exchange of particles, called carrier particles, and that what we commonly refer to as the force\u2019s field consists of these carrier particles. Specifically for the strong nuclear force, Yukawa proposed that a previously unknown particle, called a pion, is exchanged between nucleons, transmitting the force between them. Figure 23.3 illustrates how a pion would carry a force between a proton and a neutron.\n\nIn Yukawa\u2019s strong force, the carrier particle is assumed to be transmitted at the speed of light and is continually transferred between the two nucleons shown. The particle that Yukawa predicted was finally discovered within cosmic rays in 1947. Its name, the pion, stands for pi meson, where meson means medium mass; it\u2019s a medium mass because it is smaller than a nucleon but larger than an electron. Yukawa launched the field that is now called quantum chromodynamics, and the carrier particles are now called gluons due to their strong binding power. The reason for the change in the particle name will be explained when quarks are discussed later in this section.\n\nAs you may assume, the strong force is not the only force with a carrier particle. Nuclear decay from the weak force also requires a particle transfer. In the weak force are the following three: the weak negative carrier, W\u2013; the weak positive carrier, W+; and the zero charge carrier, Z0. As we will see, Fermi inferred that these particles must carry mass, as the total mass of the products of nuclear decay is slightly larger than the total mass of all reactants after nuclear decay.\n\nThe carrier particle for the electromagnetic force is, not surprisingly, the photon. After all, just as a lightbulb can emit photons from a charged tungsten filament, the photon can be used to transfer information from one electrically charged particle to another. Finally, the graviton is the proposed carrier particle for gravity. While it has not yet been found, scientists are currently looking for evidence of its existence (see Boundless Physics: Searching for the Graviton).\n\nSo how does a carrier particle transmit a fundamental force? Figure 23.4 shows a virtual photon transmitted from one positively charged particle to another. The transmitted photon is referred to as a virtual particle because it cannot be directly observed while transmitting the force. Figure 23.5 shows a way of graphing the exchange of a virtual photon between the two positively charged particles. This graph of time versus position is called a Feynman diagram, after the brilliant American physicist Richard Feynman (1918\u20131988), who developed it.\n\nThe Feynman diagram should be read from the bottom up to show the movement of particles over time. In it, you can see that the left proton is propelled leftward from the photon emission, while the right proton feels an impulse to the right when the photon is received. In addition to the Feynman diagram, Richard Feynman was one of the theorists who developed the field of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which further describes electromagnetic interactions on the submicroscopic scale. For this work, he shared the 1965 Nobel Prize with Julian Schwinger and S.I. Tomonaga. A Feynman diagram explaining the strong force interaction hypothesized by Yukawa can be seen in Figure 23.6. Here, you can see the change in particle type due to the exchange of the pi meson.\n\nThe relative masses of the listed carrier particles describe something valuable about the four fundamental forces, as can be seen in Table 23.2. W bosons (consisting of  $$\\(\\text{W}^{-}\\)$$  and  $$\\(\\text{W}^{+}\\)$$  bosons) and Z bosons ( $$\\(\\text{Z}^{0}\\)$$  bosons), carriers of the weak nuclear force, are nearly 1,000 times more massive than pions, carriers of the strong nuclear force. Simultaneously, the distance that the weak nuclear force can be transmitted is approximately  $$\\(\\frac{1}{1,000}\\)$$  times the strong force transmission distance. Unlike carrier particles, which have a limited range, the photon is a massless particle that has no limit to the transmission distance of the electromagnetic force. This relationship leads scientists to understand that the yet-unfound graviton is likely massless as well.",

                    "context": "Before looking at all the particles that make up our universe, let us first examine some of the machines that create them. The fundamental process in creating unknown particles is to accelerate known particles, such as protons or electrons, and direct a beam of them toward a target. Collisions with target nuclei provide a wealth of information, such as information obtained by Rutherford in the gold foil experiment. If the energy of the incoming particles is large enough, new matter can even be created in the collision. The more energy input or \u0394E, the more matter m can be created, according to mass energy equivalence  $$\\(m = \\text{\u0394}E/c^{2}\\)$$ . Limitations are placed on what can occur by known conservation laws, such as conservation of mass-energy, momentum, and charge. Even more interesting are the unknown limitations provided by nature. While some expected reactions do occur, others do not, and still other unexpected reactions may appear. New laws are revealed, and the vast majority of what we know about particle physics has come from accelerator laboratories. It is the particle physicist\u2019s favorite indoor sport.\n\nOur earliest model of a particle accelerator comes from the Van de Graaff generator. The relatively simple device, which you have likely seen in physics demonstrations, can be manipulated to produce potentials as great as 50 million volts. While these machines do not have energies large enough to produce new particles, analysis of their accelerated ions was instrumental in exploring several aspects of the nucleus.\n\nAnother equally famous early accelerator is the cyclotron, invented in 1930 by the American physicist, E.O. Lawrence (1901\u20131958). Figure 23.8 is a visual representation with more detail. Cyclotrons use fixed-frequency alternating electric fields to accelerate particles. The particles spiral outward in a magnetic field, making increasingly larger radius orbits during acceleration. This clever arrangement allows the successive addition of electric potential energy with each loop. As a result, greater particle energies are possible than in a Van de Graaff generator.\n\nA synchrotron is a modification of the cyclotron in which particles continually travel in a fixed-radius orbit, increasing speed each time. Accelerating voltages are synchronized with the particles to accelerate them, hence the name. Additionally, magnetic field strength is increased to keep the orbital radius constant as energy increases. A ring of magnets and accelerating tubes, as shown in Figure 23.9, are the major components of synchrotrons. High-energy particles require strong magnetic fields to steer them, so superconducting magnets are commonly employed. Still limited by achievable magnetic field strengths, synchrotrons need to be very large at very high energies since the radius of a high-energy particle\u2019s orbit is very large.\n\nTo further probe the nucleus, physicists need accelerators of greater energy and detectors of shorter wavelength. To do so requires not only greater funding but greater ingenuity as well. Colliding beams used at both the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab; see Figure 23.11) near Chicago and the LHC in Switzerland are designed to reduce energy loss in particle collisions. Typical stationary particle detectors lose a large amount of energy to the recoiling target struck by the accelerating particle. By providing head-on collisions between particles moving in opposite directions, colliding beams make it possible to create particles with momenta and kinetic energies near zero. This allows for particles of greater energy and mass to be created. Figure 23.10 is a schematic representation of this effect. In addition to circular accelerators, linear accelerators can be used to reduce energy radiation losses. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (now called the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory) in California is home to the largest such accelerator in the world.",

                    "context": "\u201cThe first principles of the universe are atoms and empty space. Everything else is merely thought to exist\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 Further, the atoms are unlimited in size and number, and they are borne along with the whole universe in a vortex, and thereby generate all composite things\u2014fire, water, air, earth. For even these are conglomerations of given atoms. And it because of their solidity that these atoms are impassive and unalterable.\u201d\n\n\u2014Diogenes Laertius (summarizing the views of Democritus, circa 460\u2013370 B.C.)\n\nThe search for fundamental particles is nothing new. Atomists of the Greek and Indian empires, like Democritus of fifth century B.C., openly wondered about the most finite components of our universe. Though dormant for centuries, curiosity about the atomic nature of matter was reinvigorated by Rutherford\u2019s gold foil experiment and the discovery of the nucleus. By the early 1930s, scientists believed they had fully determined the tiniest constituents of matter\u2014in the form of the proton, neutron, and electron.\n\nThis would be only partially true. At present, scientists know that there are hundreds of particles not unlike our electron and nucleons, all making up what some have termed the particle zoo. While we are confident that the electron remains fundamental, it is surrounded by a plethora of similar sounding terms, like leptons, hadrons, baryons, and mesons. Even though not every particle is considered fundamental, they all play a vital role in understanding the intricate structure of our universe.\n\nA fundamental particle is defined as a particle with no substructure and no finite size. According to the Standard Model, there are three types of fundamental particles: leptons, quarks, and carrier particles. As you may recall, carrier particles are responsible for transmitting fundamental forces between their interacting masses. Leptons are a group of six particles not bound by the strong nuclear force, of which the electron is one. As for quarks, they are the fundamental building blocks of a group of particles called hadrons, a group that includes both the proton and the neutron.\n\nNow for a brief history of quarks. Quarks were first proposed independently by American physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1963. Originally, three quark types\u2014or flavors\u2014were proposed with the names up (u), down (d), and strange (s).\n\nAt first, physicists expected that, with sufficient energy, we should be able to free quarks and observe them directly. However, this has not proved possible, as the current understanding is that the force holding quarks together is incredibly great and, much like a spring, increases in magnitude as the quarks are separated. As a result, when large energies are put into collisions, other particles are created\u2014but no quarks emerge. With that in mind, there is compelling evidence for the existence of quarks. By 1967, experiments at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory scattering 20-GeV electrons from protons produced results like Rutherford had obtained for the nucleus nearly 60 years earlier. The SLAC scattering experiments showed unambiguously that there were three point-like (meaning they had sizes considerably smaller than the probe\u2019s wavelength) charges inside the proton as seen in Figure 23.12. This evidence made all but the most skeptical admit that there was validity to the quark substructure of hadrons.\n\nThe inclusion of the strange quark with Zweig and Gell-Mann\u2019s model concerned physicists. While the up and down quarks demonstrated fairly clear symmetry and were present in common fundamental particles like protons and neutrons, the strange quark did not have a counterpart of its own. This thought, coupled with the four known leptons at the time, caused scientists to predict that a fourth quark, yet to be found, also existed. \n\nIn 1974, two groups of physicists independently discovered a particle with this new quark, labeled charmed. This completed the second exotic quark pair, strange (s) and charmed (c). A final pair of quarks was proposed when a third pair of leptons was discovered in 1975. The existence of the bottom (b) quark and the top (t) quark was verified through experimentation in 1976 and 1995, respectively. While it may seem odd that so much time would elapse between the original quark discovery in 1967 and the verification of the top quark in 1995, keep in mind that each quark discovered had a progressively larger mass. As a result, each new quark has required more energy to discover.\n\nOne of the most confounding traits of quarks is their electric charge. Long assumed to be discrete, and specifically a multiple of the elementary charge of the electron, the electric charge of an individual quark is fractional and thus seems to violate a presumed tenet of particle physics. The fractional charge of quarks, which are  $$\\(\\pm \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)q_{e}\\)$$  and  $$\\(\\pm \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)q_{e}\\)$$, are the only structures found in nature with a nonintegral number of charge  $$\\(q\\)$$ . However, note that despite this odd construction, the fractional value of the quark does not violate the quantum nature of the charge. After all, free quarks cannot be found in nature, and all quarks are bound into arrangements in which an integer number of charge is constructed. Table 23.3 shows the six known quarks, in addition to their antiquark components, as will be discussed later in this section.\n\nWhile the term flavor is used to differentiate between types of quarks, the concept of color is more analogous to the electric charge in that it is primarily responsible for the force interactions between quarks. Note\u2014Take a moment to think about the electrostatic force. It is the electric charge that causes attraction and repulsion. It is the same case here but with a color charge. The three colors available to a quark are red, green, and blue, with antiquarks having colors of anti-red (or cyan), anti-green (or magenta), and anti-blue (or yellow).\n\nWhy use colors when discussing quarks? After all, the quarks are not actually colored with visible light. The reason colors are used is because the properties of a quark are analogous to the three primary and secondary colors mentioned above. Just as different colors of light can be combined to create white, different colors of quark may be combined to construct a particle like a proton or neutron. In fact, for each hadron, the quarks must combine such that their color sums to white! Recall that two up quarks and one down quark construct a proton, as seen in Figure 23.12. The sum of the three quarks\u2019 colors\u2014red, green, and blue\u2014yields the color white. This theory of color interaction within particles is called quantum chromodynamics, or QCD. As part of QCD, the strong nuclear force can be explained using color. In fact, some scientists refer to the color force, not the strong force, as one of the four fundamental forces. Figure 23.13 is a Feynman diagram showing the interaction between two quarks by using the transmission of a colored gluon. Note that the gluon is also considered the charge carrier for the strong nuclear force.\n\nNote that quark flavor may have any color. For instance, in Figure 23.13, the down quark has a red color and a green color. In other words, colors are not specific to a particle quark flavor.",

Known particles can be divided into three major groups\u2014leptons, hadrons, and carrier particles (gauge bosons). All particles of matter have an antimatter counterpart that has the opposite charge and certain other quantum numbers. These matter\u2013antimatter pairs are otherwise very similar but will annihilate when brought together. The strong force is carried by eight proposed particles called gluons, which are intimately connected to a quantum number called color\u2014their governing theory is thus called quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

                    "context": "Particles can be revealingly grouped according to what forces they feel between them. All particles (even those that are massless) are affected by gravity since gravity affects the space and time in which particles exist. All charged particles are affected by the electromagnetic force, as are neutral particles that have an internal distribution of charge (such as the neutron with its magnetic moment). Special names are given to particles that feel the strong and weak nuclear forces. Hadrons are particles that feel the strong nuclear force, whereas leptons are particles that do not. All particles feel the weak nuclear force. This means that hadrons are distinguished by being able to feel both the strong and weak nuclear forces. Leptons and hadrons are distinguished in other ways as well. Leptons are fundamental particles that have no measurable size, while hadrons are composed of quarks and have a diameter on the order of 10\u201315 m. Six particles, including the electron and neutrino, make up the list of known leptons. There are hundreds of complex particles in the hadron class, a few of which (including the proton and neutron) are listed in Table 23.4.\n\nThere are many more leptons, mesons, and baryons yet to be discovered and measured. The purpose of trying to uncover the smallest indivisible things in existence is to explain the world around us through forces and the interactions between particles, galaxies and objects. This is why a handful of scientists devote their life\u2019s work to smashing together small particles.\n\nWhat internal structure makes a proton so different from an electron? The proton, like all hadrons, is made up of quarks. A few examples of hadron quark composition can be seen in Figure 23.14. As shown, each hadron is constructed of multiple quarks. As mentioned previously, the fractional quark charge in all four hadrons sums to the particle\u2019s integral value. Also, notice that the color composition for each of the four particles adds to white. Each of the particles shown is constructed of up, down, and their antiquarks. This is not surprising, as the quarks strange, charmed, top, and bottom are found in only our most exotic particles.\n\nYou may have noticed that while the proton and neutron in Figure 23.14 are composed of three quarks, both pions are comprised of only two quarks. This refers to a final delineation in particle structure. Particles with three quarks are called baryons. These are heavy particles that can decay into another baryon. Particles with only two quarks\u2014a-quark\u2013anti-quark pair\u2014are called mesons. These are particles of moderate mass that cannot decay into the more massive baryons.\n\nBefore continuing, take a moment to view Figure 23.15. In this figure, you can see the strong force reimagined as a color force. The particles interacting in this figure are the proton and neutron, just as they were in Figure 23.6. This reenvisioning of the strong force as an interaction between colored quarks is the critical concept behind quantum chromodynamics.",

Known particles can be divided into three major groups\u2014leptons, hadrons, and carrier particles (gauge bosons). All particles of matter have an antimatter counterpart that has the opposite charge and certain other quantum numbers. These matter\u2013antimatter pairs are otherwise very similar but will annihilate when brought together. The strong force is carried by eight proposed particles called gluons, which are intimately connected to a quantum number called color\u2014their governing theory is thus called quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

                    "context": "Antimatter was first discovered in the form of the positron, the positively charged electron. In 1932, American physicist Carl Anderson discovered the positron in cosmic ray studies. Through a cloud chamber modified to curve the trajectories of cosmic rays, Anderson noticed that the curves of some particles followed that of a negative charge, while others curved like a positive charge. However, the positive curve showed not the mass of a proton but the mass of an electron. This outcome is shown in Figure 23.16 and suggests the existence of a positively charged version of the electron, created by the destruction of solar photons.\n\nAntimatter is considered the opposite of matter. For most antiparticles, this means that they share the same properties as their original particles with the exception of their charge. This is why the positron can be considered a positive electron while the antiproton is considered a negative proton. The idea of an opposite charge for neutral particles (like the neutron) can be confusing, but it makes sense when considered from the quark perspective. Just as the neutron is composed of one up quark and two down quarks (of charge $$\\(+ \\frac{2}{3}\\)$$and $$\\(- \\frac{1}{3}\\)$$, respectively), the antineutron is composed of one anti\u2013up quark and two anti\u2013down quarks (of charge  $$\\(- \\frac{2}{3}\\)$$  and $$\\(+ \\frac{1}{3}\\)$$, respectively). While the overall charge of the neutron remains the same, its constituent particles do not!\n\nA word about antiparticles: Like regular particles, antiparticles could function just fine on their own. In fact, a universe made up of antimatter may operate just as our own matter-based universe does. However, we do not know fully whether this is the case. The reason for this is annihilation. Annihilation is the process of destruction that occurs when a particle and its antiparticle interact. As soon as two particles (like a positron and an electron) coincide, they convert their masses to energy through the equation  $$\\(E = mc^{2}\\)$$ . This mass-to-energy conversion, which typically results in photon release, happens instantaneously and makes it very difficult for scientists to study antimatter. That said, scientists have had success creating antimatter through high-energy particle collisions. Both antineutrons and antiprotons were created through accelerator experiments in 1956, and an anti\u2013hydrogen atom was even created at CERN in 1995! As referenced in Figure 22.40, the annihilation of antiparticles is currently used in medical studies to determine the location of radioisotopes.",

                    "context": "The Standard Model of the atom refers to the current scientific view of the fundamental components and interacting forces of matter. The Standard Model (Figure 23.17) shows the six quarks that bind to form all hadrons, the six lepton particles already considered fundamental, the four carrier particles (or gauge bosons) that transmit forces between the leptons and quarks, and the recently added Higgs boson (which will be discussed shortly). This totals 17 fundamental particles, combinations of which are responsible for all known matter in our entire universe! When adding the antiquarks and antileptons, 31 components make up the Standard Model.\n\nFigure 23.17 shows all particles within the Standard Model of the atom. Not only does this chart divide all known particles by color-coded group, but it also provides information on particle stability. Note that the color-coding system in this chart is separate from the red, green, and blue color labeling system of quarks. The first three columns represent the three families of matter. The first column, considered Family 1, represents particles that make up normal matter, constructing the protons, neutrons, and electrons that make up the common world. Family 2, represented from the charm quark to the muon neutrino, is comprised of particles that are more massive. The leptons in this group are less stable and more likely to decay. Family 3, represented by the third column, are more massive still and decay more quickly. The order of these families also conveniently represents the order in which these particles were discovered.\n\nThe Standard Model also summarizes the fundamental forces that exist as particles interact. A closer look at the Standard Model, as shown in Figure 23.18, reveals that the arrangement of carrier particles describes these interactions.\n\nEach of the shaded areas represents a fundamental force and its constituent particles. The red shaded area shows all particles involved in the strong nuclear force, which we now know is due to quantum chromodynamics. The blue shaded area corresponds to the electromagnetic force, while the green shaded area corresponds to the weak nuclear force, which affects all quarks and leptons. The electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force are considered united by the electroweak force within the Standard Model. Also, because definitive evidence of the graviton is yet to be found, it is not included in the Standard Model.",

                    "context": "One interesting feature of the Standard Model shown in Figure 23.18 is that, while the gluon and photon have no mass, the Z and W bosons are very massive. What supplies these quickly moving particles with mass and not the gluons and photons? Furthermore, what causes some quarks to have more mass than others?\n\nIn the 1960s, British physicist Peter Higgs and others speculated that the W and Z bosons were actually just as massless as the gluon and photon. However, as the W and Z bosons traveled from one particle to another, they were slowed down by the presence of a Higgs field, much like a fish swimming through water. The thinking was that the existence of the Higgs field would slow down the bosons, causing them to decrease in energy and thereby transfer this energy to mass. Under this theory, all particles pass through the Higgs field, which exists throughout the universe. The gluon and photon travel through this field as well but are able to do so unaffected.\n\nThe presence of a force from the Higgs field suggests the existence of its own carrier particle, the Higgs boson. This theorized boson interacts with all particles but gluons and photons, transferring force from the Higgs field. Particles with large mass (like the top quark) are more likely to receive force from the Higgs boson.\n\nWhile it is difficult to examine a field, it is somewhat simpler to find evidence of its carrier. On July 4, 2012, two groups of scientists at the LHC independently confirmed the existence of a Higgs-like particle. By examining trillions of proton\u2013proton collisions at energies of 7 to 8 TeV, LHC scientists were able to determine the constituent particles that created the protons. In this data, scientists found a particle with similar mass, spin, parity, and interactions with other particles that matched the Higgs boson predicted decades prior. On March 13, 2013, the existence of the Higgs boson was tentatively confirmed by CERN. Peter Higgs and Francois Englert received the Nobel Prize in 2013 for the \u201ctheoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin and mass of subatomic particles.\u201d",

Quarks come in six flavors and three colors and occur only in combinations that produce white. Hadrons are thought to be composed of quarks, with baryons having three quarks and mesons having a quark and an antiquark. Known particles can be divided into three major groups\u2014leptons, hadrons, and carrier particles (gauge bosons). All particles of matter have an antimatter counterpart that has the opposite charge and certain other quantum numbers. These matter\u2013antimatter pairs are otherwise very similar but will annihilate when brought together. The strong force is carried by eight proposed particles called gluons, which are intimately connected to a quantum number called color\u2014their governing theory is thus called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Taken together, QCD and the electroweak theory are widely accepted as the Standard Model of particle physics. ",

                {
                    "context": "Present quests to show that the four basic forces are different manifestations of a single unified force that follow a long tradition. In the nineteenth century, the distinct electric and magnetic forces were shown to be intimately connected and are now collectively called the electromagnetic force. More recently, the weak nuclear force was united with the electromagnetic force. As shown in Figure 23.19, carrier particles transmit three of the four fundamental forces in very similar ways. With these considerations in mind, it is natural to suggest that a theory may be constructed in which the strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and electromagnetic forces are all unified. The search for a correct theory linking the forces, called the Grand Unified Theory (GUT), is explored in this section.\n\nIn the 1960s, the electroweak theory was developed by Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow, and Abdus Salam. This theory proposed that the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are identical at sufficiently high energies. At lower energies, like those in our present-day universe, the two forces remain united but manifest themselves in different ways. One of the main consequences of the electroweak theory was the prediction of three short-range carrier particles, now known as the  $$\\(W^{+},\\)$$ $$\\(W^{-},\\)$$ and  $$\\(\\text{Z}^{0}\\)$$  bosons. Not only were three particles predicted, but the mass of each  $$\\(\\text{W}^{+}\\)$$  and  $$\\(\\text{W}^{-}\\)$$  boson was predicted to be 81 GeV/c2, and that of the  $$\\(\\text{Z}^{0}\\)$$  boson was predicted to be 90 GeV/c2. In 1983, these carrier particles were observed at CERN with the predicted characteristics, including masses having those predicted values as given in Figure 23.17.\n\nHow can forces be unified? They are definitely distinct under most circumstances. For example, they are carried by different particles and have greatly different strengths. But experiments show that at extremely short distances and at extremely high energies, the strengths of the forces begin to become more similar, as seen in Figure 23.20.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the short ranges and large masses of the weak carrier bosons require correspondingly high energies to create them. Thus, the energy scale on the horizontal axis of Figure 23.20 also corresponds to shorter and shorter distances (going from left to right), with 100 GeV corresponding to approximately 10\u221218 m, for example. At that distance, the strengths of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are the same. To test this, energies of about 100 GeV are put into the system. When this occurs, the  $$\\(\\text{W}^{+}\\)$$,  $$\\(\\text{W}^{-}\\)$$, and  $$\\(\\text{Z}^{0}\\)$$  carrier particles are created and released. At those and higher energies, the masses of the carrier particles become less and less relevant, and the  $$\\(\\text{Z}^{0}\\)$$  boson in particular resembles the massless, chargeless photon. As further energy is added, the  $$\\(\\text{W}^{+}\\)$$,  $$\\(\\text{W}^{-}\\)$$, and  $$\\(\\text{Z}^{0}\\)$$  particles are further transformed into massless carrier particles even more similar to photons and gluons.\n\nThe extremely short distances and high energies at which the electroweak force becomes identical with the strong nuclear force are not reachable with any conceivable human-built accelerator. At energies of about 1014 GeV (16,000 J per particle), distances of about 10 to 30 m can be probed. Such energies are needed to test the theory directly, but these are about 1010 times higher than the maximum energy associated with the LHC, and the distances are about 10 to 12 smaller than any structure we have direct knowledge of. This would be the realm of various GUTs, of which there are many, since there is no constraining evidence at these energies and distances. Past experience has shown that anytime you probe so many orders of magnitude further, you find the unexpected.\n\nWhile direct evidence of a GUT is not presently possible, that does not rule out the ability to assess a GUT through an indirect process. Current GUTs require various other events as a consequence of their theory. Some GUTs require the existence of magnetic monopoles, very massive individual north- and south-pole particles, which have not yet been proven to exist, while others require the use of extra dimensions. However, not all theories result in the same consequences. For example, disproving the existence of magnetic monopoles will not disprove all GUTs. Much of the science we accept in our everyday lives is based on different models, each with their own strengths and limitations. Although a particular model may have drawbacks, that does not necessarily mean that it should be discounted completely.\n\nOne consequence of GUTs that can theoretically be assessed is proton decay. Multiple current GUTs hypothesize that the stable proton should actually decay at a lifetime of 1031 years. While this time is incredibly large (keep in mind that the age of the universe is less than 14 billion years), scientists at the Super-Kamiokande in Japan have used a 50,000-ton tank of water to search for its existence. The decay of a single proton in the Super-Kamiokande tank would be observed by a detector, thereby providing support for the predicting GUT model. However, as of 2014, 17 years into the experiment, decay is yet to be found. This time span equates to a minimum limit on proton life of  $$\\(5.9\\  \\times \\ 10^{33}\\)$$ years. While this result certainly does not support many grand unifying theories, an acceptable model may still exist.",

                    "context": "Nature is full of examples where the macroscopic and microscopic worlds intertwine. Newton realized that the nature of gravity on Earth that pulls an apple to the ground could explain the motion of the moon and planets so much farther away. Decays of tiny nuclei explain the hot interior of the Earth. Fusion of nuclei likewise explains the energy of stars. Today, the patterns in particle physics seem to be explaining the evolution and character of the universe. And the nature of the universe has implications for unexplored regions of particle physics.\n\nIn 1929, Edwin Hubble observed that all but the closest galaxies surrounding our own had a red shift in their hydrogen spectra that was proportional to their distance from us. Applying the Doppler Effect, Hubble recognized that this meant that all galaxies were receding from our own, with those farther away receding even faster. Knowing that our place in the universe was no more unique than any other, the implication was clear: The space within the universe itself was expanding. Just like pen marks on an expanding balloon, everything in the universe was accelerating away from everything else.\n\nFigure 23.21 shows how the recession of galaxies looks like the remnants of a gigantic explosion, the famous Big Bang. Extrapolating backward in time, the Big Bang would have occurred between 13 and 15 billion years ago, when all matter would have been at a single point. From this, questions instantly arise. What caused the explosion? What happened before the Big Bang? Was there a before, or did time start then? For our purposes, the biggest question relating to the Big Bang is this: How does the Big Bang relate to the unification of the fundamental forces?\n\nTo fully understand the conditions of the very early universe, recognize that as the universe contracts to the size of the Big Bang, changes will occur. The density and temperature of the universe will increase dramatically. As particles become closer together, they will become too close to exist as we know them. The high energies will create other, more unusual particles to exist in greater abundance. Knowing this, let\u2019s move forward from the start of the universe, beginning with the Big Bang, as illustrated in Figure 23.22.\n\nThe Planck Epoch $$\\(\\left( {0\\rightarrow 10^{-43}s} \\right)\\)$$ \u2014Though scientists are unable to model the conditions of the Planck Epoch in the laboratory, speculation is that at this time compressed energy was great enough to reach the immense  $$\\(10^{19}\\)$$  GeV necessary to unify gravity with all other forces. As a result, modern cosmology suggests that all four forces would have existed as one force, a hypothetical superforce as suggested by the Theory of Everything.\n\nThe Grand Unification Epoch $$\\(\\left( {10^{-43}\\rightarrow 10^{-36}s} \\right)\\)$$ \u2014As the universe expands, the temperatures necessary to maintain the superforce decrease. As a result, gravity separates, leaving the electroweak and strong nuclear forces together. At this time, the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces are identical, matching the conditions requested in the Grand Unification Theory.\n\nThe Inflationary Epoch $$\\(\\left( {10^{- 36}\\rightarrow 10^{- 32}s} \\right)\\)$$ \u2014The separation of the strong nuclear force from the electroweak force during this time is thought to have been responsible for the massive inflation of the universe. Corresponding to the steep diagonal line on the left side of Figure 23.22, the universe may have expanded by a factor of  $$\\(10^{50}\\)$$  or more in size. In fact, the expansion was so great during this time that it actually occurred faster than the speed of light! Unfortunately, there is little hope that we may be able to test the inflationary scenario directly since it occurs at energies near  $$\\(10^{14}\\)$$  GeV, vastly greater than the limits of modern accelerators.\n\nThe Electroweak Epoch $$\\(\\left( {10^{-32}\\rightarrow 10^{-11}s} \\right)\\)$$ \u2014Now separated from both gravity and the strong nuclear force, the electroweak force exists as a singular force during this time period. As stated earlier, scientists are able to create the energies at this stage in the universe\u2019s expansion, needing only 100 GeV, as shown in Figure 23.20. W and Z bosons, as well as the Higgs boson, are released during this time.\n\nThe Quark Era $$\\(\\left( {10^{-11}\\rightarrow 10^{-6}s} \\right)\\)$$ \u2014During the Quark Era, the universe has expanded and temperatures have decreased to the point at which all four fundamental forces have separated. Additionally, quarks began to take form as energies decreased.\n\nAs the universe expanded, further eras took place, allowing for the existence of hadrons, leptons, and photons, the fundamental particles of the standard model. Eventually, in nucleosynthesis, nuclei would be able to form, and the basic building blocks of atomic matter could take place. Using particle accelerators, we are very much working backwards in an attempt to understand the universe. It is encouraging to see that the macroscopic conditions of the Big Bang align nicely with our submicroscopic particle theory.",
