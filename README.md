ðŸ“– Book2dial is grounded in textbooks from four domains: math, business, science, and social science. Our dataset contains teacher-student interactions that take the form of conversational question-answering (QA) interactions, where curious students ask teachers questions about the textbook content, and teachers provide answers based on the textbook.

# Description
In this project, we propose a framework for generating synthetic teacher-student interactions grounded in textbooks. Our approaches capture one aspect of learning interactions where curious students with partial knowledge interactively ask a teacher questions about the material in the textbook. We highlight various quality criteria such dialogues should fulfill and compare several approaches relying on either prompting or fine-tuning large language models. We provide evidence in our paper to show our generated dialogue dataset can be used to fine-tune educational chatbots.
